       "['In our Company’s 2021 Sustainability Report, CEO Mike Roman states, “We are committed to being leaders in sustainability.”1 A review of that report reveals our Company has addressed many environmental concerns. But 3M’s commitment is limited. For example:\\n3M is active in three trade associations that work against comprehensive U.S. policies to address climate change.2\\n3M does not appear to have committed to meet the Science-Based Targets initiative for a 1.5- degree Celsius world3 and failed to receive an “A” grade in 2020 from CDP, a widely used and respected climate rating.4\\nBelgian regulators recently ordered 3M to stop PFAS production after recent blood samples taken from 800 people near 3M’s plant showed elevated levels of PFAS.5\\nIt appears our Company only addresses sustainability issues when that pursuit optimizes 3M’s financial return. The Sustainability Report states:\\nOur priority is the comprehensive management of enterprise risks through an ethical tone, governance processes, and clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability.6\\nThis prioritization of risks to the enterprise, rather than risks to the environment, means that 3M only addresses environmental issues that threaten its ability to generate profits. Risks to the global community that do not threaten 3M are not prioritized, so that 3M can continue to profit from conduct that threatens the environment, as it does not create risk for 3M itself.\\nBut again in Company profit that comes at the expense of the environment is a bad trade for most 3M shareholders, who are diversified and rely on broad economic growth to achieve their financial objectives. A Company strategy that increases its own financial returns but threatens global GDP is counter to the interests of most 3M shareholders: the potential drag on GDP created by environmental costs will directly reduce diversified portfolio returns over the long term.7\\nThis proposal asks the Board to commission a report that analyzes the trade-offs 3M is making by prioritizing enterprise risk over risks to the environment and the global economy from the perspective of its largely diversified shareholders, whose investment portfolios may be at grave risk from environmental threats.\\nThe requested report will help shareholders determine whether current Company policies serve shareholders’ best interests and whether 3M should prioritize certain environmental issues over financial returns.\\n1 3M 2021 Sustainability Report at 3.\\n2\\xa0https://grist.org/accountability/report-corporations-are-tanking-americas-best-shot-at-fighting-climate-change/\\n3\\xa0https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action\\n4\\xa0https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?per_page=10&queries%5Bname%5D=3m&sort_by=project_year&sort_dir=desc\\n5\\xa0https://www.startribune.com/3m-fails-to-overturn-regulators-shutdown-of-pfas-production-in-belgium/600114579/\\n6 at 95.\\n7\\xa0https://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/universal_ownership_full.pdf\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders ask that the Board of Directors commission and publish a report on (1) the link between the environmental costs created by 3M’s operations and political influence activities and 3M’s continuing prioritization of enterprise risk, and (2) the manner in which such costs and prioritization may affect the market returns available to its diversified shareholders.\\n',\n",
       " 'We believe in full disclosure of Abbott Laboratories’ (“Abbott”) direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether Abbott’s lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and in the best interests of stockholders.\\n\\nResolved:\\nThe stockholders of Abbott request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing:\\n1.\\xa0Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.\\n2. Payments by Abbott used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.\\n3. Abbott’s membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.\\n4. Description of management’s decision-making process and the Board’s oversight for making payments described in section 2 above.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAbbott spent $36,700,000 from 2010 – 2019 on federal lobbying. This figure does not include state lobbying, where Abbott also lobbies in 37 states[1]\\xa0but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Abbott spent $896,284 on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2019.\\nAbbott sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce, which has spent over $1.6 billion on lobbying since 1998, and the boards of the Advanced Medical Technology Association and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association, which together spent $9,300,408 on lobbying for 2018 and 2019 and have drawn scrutiny for lobbying to weaken mandatory disclosure of medical device incidents.[2]\\xa0Abbott does not disclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare organizations, or the amounts used for lobbying.\\nWe are concerned that Abbott’s lack of lobbying disclosure presents significant reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, Abbott publicly supported COVID-19 relief efforts, but the Chamber directly lobbied against using the Defense Production Act for production of personal protective equipment for workers.[3]\\xa0Abbott supports the World Health Organization’s goal of increasing breast-feeding rates, its lobbying on attracted scrutiny after the Trump administration blocked a World Health Organization resolution encouraging breastfeeding.[4]\\xa0And Abbott drew attention and ultimately cut ties with one of its lobbyists over his controversial statements about Black Lives Matter.[5]\\nWe believe the reputational damage stemming from these misalignments harms long-term value creation by Abbott. Thus, we urge Abbott to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n[1]\\xa0https://publicintegrity.org/state-politics/here-are-the-interests-lobbying-in-every-statehouse/\\n[2]\\xa0https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/medical-device-makers-spend-millions-lobbying-loosen-regs-d-c-n940351.\\n[3]\\xa0https://corporatereformcoalition.org/chamber-dpa.\\n[4]\\xa0https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/07/the-epic-battle-between-breast-milk-and-infant-formula-companies/564782/.\\n[5]\\xa0https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-campaign-begins-paying-matt-schlapp-as-his-lobbying-clients-flee\\n',\n",

Yet AbbVie is a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has consistently lobbied to roll back U.S. climate regulation and promoted regulations that would slow the transition towards a low carbon energy mix.\\nAbbVie has stated \"We are committed to equity, equality, diversity and inclusion (“EED&I”).

In a recent report put out by consulting firm Deloitte titled “Addressing Climate Change”1 the firm asked 353 committee members of large corporations, “How prepared are we to deal with climate risk”? Globally 42% of respondents indicated that their company’s “climate response is not as swift and robust as they would like” and almost half “do not believe that they are well-equipped to fulfil their climate regulatory responsibilities.” Deloitte called the responses “sobering.”\\nWith over 78 offices in more than 50 countries, Alphabet has a major international presence. Though ESG or environmental, social and corporate governance issues are at the forefront of our company ethos, at the director level, the board doesn’t seem to have any oversight with environmental sustainability.\\nCurrent board committees at Alphabet include the Audit and Compliance Committee, Leadership Development and Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Executive Committee. Within the verbiage of all committees’ responsibilities and purpose, there are zero mentions of climate change and zero mentions of the environment. Within the Audit and Compliance Committee there is one mention of sustainability, but we feel that because of the scale of climate change, a separate committee specifically focused on environmental issues is warranted. Alphabet’s commitment to ESG as a corporation is strong but is the board “on board”.\\nThe purpose of an environmental sustainability committee could be to initiate, review, and make policy recommendations regarding topics such as global climate change, resource shortages, biodiversity loss, and political instability due to changing environmental conditions. It could also propose approval of sustainability policies to the full Board of Directors and review management and control systems for non-financial risks. Many of these policies may already be in place at the company level but having additional board oversight will only strengthen these policies.\\nNothing herein shall restrict the power of the Board of Directors to manage the business and affairs of the company. The Board Committee on Environmental Sustainability shall not incur any costs to the company except as authorized by the Board of Directors.\\nHaving an independent committee with focused fiduciary duties for oversight of environmental sustainability policies and practices will only strengthen the bottom line and reinforce our company’s position as an industry leader in environmental stewardship. The significant risks associated with climate change warrant more fine-tuned accountability and responsibility at the board level.

Indicators 1 through 5 of the Benchmark seek reporting on companies’ net zero emissions ambitions; short, medium and long term greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions goals; and strategic actions planned to achieve decarbonization targets. [2]\\nAmerican Water Works is the largest and most geographically diverse publicly traded water and wastewater treatment utility company in the United States with approximately 90 percent of its electricity consumption and over 80 percent of GHG emissions related to water pumping [3].

While these are credible first steps, it has not set medium and long-term targets to reduce scope 1 or 2 GHG emissions nor set any goals for scope 3 emissions. The company does not have a Net Zero commitment, has not set targets in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, nor disclosed a plan for how to achieve Paris-aligned GHG emissions reductions.\\nBy setting and disclosing medium and long-term GHG emissions reduction targets, including net zero ambitions, and developing and disclosing a clear climate transition plan, our company can assure investors that management is reducing its full climate impact, building on climate-related opportunities, and addressing growing climate risk, including customers’ access to water due to extreme weather events.\\n[1]\\xa0https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-portfolio-perspectives-february-2020.pdf\\n[2]\\xa0https://www.climateaction100.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Climate-Action-100-Benchmark-Indicators-FINAL-3.12.pdf\\n[3]\\xa0https://s26.q4cdn.com/750150140/files/doc_downloads/esg_docs/2021/2019-2020-Sustainability-Report-(1).pdf\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that American Water Works issue a report within a year, and annually thereafter, at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information, disclosing medium- and long-term greenhouse gas targets aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and progress made in achieving them.

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent “Emissions Gap Report” from the United Nations Environment Programme (October 26, 2021), critical gaps remain between the commitments of national governments and the actions necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policymakers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels present regulatory, reputational, and legal risks to companies. Such policy engagement also presents systemic risks to economies and markets, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, undermine economic stability, and introduce into investment portfolios uncertainty and volatility. We believe Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps mitigate these risks and contributes positively to the long-term value of companies.\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis. When a company presents itself as a proponent of climate action but funds organizations that work against policy solutions, it exposes itself to potential reputational damage, especially in this age of social media.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C—as an imperative. We remain convinced that unabated climate change characterized by “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater will have unacceptable and far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal implications.\\nAmgen presently provides insufficient information to demonstrate how our company works to ensure its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals, and what management and the board do to address misalignments. While the company publicly discloses a list of its trade association memberships, it does not discuss any direct engagement with them on climate change, their climate policy positions, its role within each association, nor does the company disclose any actions taken in the event of misalignments on climate policy. For instance, Amgen is a member of the US Chamber of Commerce which has a history of actively and negatively lobbying on US climate policy.\\nThus, we urge the Board and management to assess the company’s lobbying on climate policy and report to shareholders.\\xa0\\n',\n",

       " 'In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evaluated the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and advised that net carbon emissions must fall 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and prevent the worst consequences of climate change. However, in 2020, the UN reported the world is “way off-track” from achieving these goals.1\\nExceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius presents risks to the global economy and investors: up to 10% of total global economic value is projected to be lost by 2050 under current emissions trajectories. A warming climate is associated with supply chain disruptions, reduced resource availability, lost production, political instability, reduced worker efficiency, and adverse health impacts that disproportionally affect low-income communities and communities of color.2\\nBJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc. (“BJ’s”) does not disclose its carbon footprint, nor does it have greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals of any kind.3 While its peers are addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, BJ’s appears to be falling behind. Peers including Kohl’s, Walmart, Williams-Sonoma, and Target have committed to set third-party verified GHG goals aligned with climate science via the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Walmart has committed to reduce absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030, and will reduce CO2e emissions from upstream and downstream scope 3 sources by one billion metric tons within the same timeframe. Williams-Sonoma has committed to a 50% scope 1 and 2 and 14% scope 3 GHG emissions reduction by 2030. Target has committed to reduce scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 30% by 2030, and that 80% of its purchased goods and services suppliers will set science-based scope 1 and 2 targets by 2023.\\nGiven the impact of climate change on the economy, the environment, and human systems, proponents believe the BJ’s board and management have a responsibility to investors and stakeholders to disclose and adopt GHG goals aligned with a 1.5 degree scenario and to outline a clear plan that demonstrates accountability. Independently verified, science-based goals covering scopes 1, 2, and 3 would provide shareholders with objective assurance that BJ’s is doing its part to reduce emissions in a comprehensive and timely manner.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc. adopt and disclose independently verified short, medium, and long-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, inclusive of emissions from its full value chain, in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner and to attain appropriate emissions reductions prior to 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn assessing targets, we recommend, at management’s discretion:\\nConsideration of approaches used by advisory groups such as the Science Based Targets initiative.\\nDisclosing these targets to investors at least 180 days prior to the next annual meeting.\\n',\n",
       " \"Resolved:\\nShareholders ask that, to the extent practicable, consistent with fiduciary duties, and otherwise legally and contractually permissible, the Company adopt stewardship practices designed to curtail corporate activities that externalize social and environmental costs that are likely to decrease the returns of portfolios that are diversified in accordance with portfolio theory, even if such curtailment could decrease returns at the externalizing company.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nOur Company is the world’s largest asset manager, with close to $10 trillion in assets under management, primarily weighted toward indexed strategies. In line with portfolio theory, most of its clients are likely to be broadly diversified.1 Overall return of the financial markets (“beta”) is the primary determinant of diversified investors’ return. Beta itself relies on a healthy economy, which in turn relies on healthy social and environmental systems. But those systems are at risk from corporate practices that reduce the value of the economy by externalizing social and environmental costs. In short, a company’s externalities harm its diversified shareholders, even if they do not harm the company itself.2 Given its market position, BlackRock’s stewardship activities—engaging with portfolio companies and voting their shares—could significantly improve beta by discouraging corporate practices that externalize costs. This would increase the portfolio value of BlackRock’s clients, and also increase the value of the assets it manages, thereby improving the returns of both its clients and shareholders. However, BlackRock’s social and environmental stewardship only focuses on improving individual company performance. BlackRock commits to engagement “that supports companies[']… efforts to deliver… value to shareholders.”3 In contrast, the Company’s stewardship policy does not address practices of a company that harm the global economy unless those practices also harm that company’s financial performance. Indeed, BlackRock says expressly that it does “not tell management what to do.”4 This appears to be the case even if doing so were necessary to protect commonly shared social and environmental resources from exploitation. Similarly, BlackRock asks companies to have business plans “aligned” with a net-zero economy and to be “resilient” in a scenario where warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, 5 but such standards focus on the ability of the company to operate successfully in a world that is addressing climate change. In contrast, there is no BlackRock policy requiring companies do their part to ensure those goals are met: that would be telling management “what to do.” Stewardship policies designed to directly support the health of social and environmental systems would promote the interests of the BlackRock’s clients and shareholders.\\n\",\n",

Boeing’s membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation\\n4. Description of management’s and the Board’s decision-making process and oversight for making payments described above\\nFor purposes of this proposal, a “grassroots lobbying communication” is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. “Indirect lobbying” is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Boeing is a member. Both “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.\\nThe report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on Boeing’s website.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nBoeing spent $179,300,000 from 2010 – 2020 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying, where Boeing also lobbies but where disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Boeing spent $1,116,000 on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2020. And Boeing also lobbies abroad, spending between €500,000 – €599,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2020. Boeing has attracted scrutiny for funding the EU Reporter, described as “EU lobbying dressed up as journalism.”1\\nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and often undisclosed grassroots activity, and these groups may be spending “at least double what’s publicly reported.”2 Boeing belongs to the Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers and US Chamber Commerce, which together spent $108,148,000 on lobbying for 2020. Boeing does not disclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare organizations, nor amounts used for lobbying, including grassroots. Grassroots lobbying does not get reported at the federal level under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and disclosure is uneven or absent in states.\\nWe are concerned that Boeing’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions or takes controversial positions. For example, Boeing believes in addressing climate change, yet the Chamber opposed the Paris climate accord. Boeing signed a statement opposing state voter restrictions, yet the Chamber lobbied against the For the People Act.3 And while Boeing has previously drawn scrutiny for avoiding federal taxes,4 its trade associations are lobbying against raising corporate taxes to fund health care, education and safety net programs.5\\n1\\xa0https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-eu-media-peddling-undisclosed-influence/.\\n2\\xa0https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double-whats- publicly-reported/.\\n3\\xa0https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/554430-watchdog-group-launches-campaign-to- pressure?rl=1.\\n4\\xa0https://itep.org/boeing-paid-tax-rate-of-8-4-in-previous-decade-but-trump-to-speak-about-why-it-needed-his- corporate-tax-cut/.\\n5\\xa0https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/.\\xa0\\n',\n",

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission underscored that climate change could\\xa0impair the productive capacity\\xa0of the U.S. economy.\\nShareholders are increasingly concerned about material climate risk to both their companies and their portfolios. The Climate Action 100+ initiative, a coalition of more than 617 investors with over $55 trillion in assets, issued a Net Zero Benchmark (Benchmark) calling on companies to develop targets and a plan to reduce their scope 1-3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net zero, improve climate governance, and provide specific climate related financial disclosures.\\nA failure to comply with Benchmark goals and disclosures is likely to pose a material risk to Boeing and its shareholders, in particular the failure to clearly disclose whether the Company has adopted net zero greenhouse gas reduction goals across its full range of emissions.\\nFailure to address such a critical climate issue may have a negative effect on Boeing’s cost of capital and shareholders’ financial returns.\\xa0BlackRock’s CEO notes\\xa0that investment flows into sustainable and climate aligned assets will drive long term outperformance and that\\xa0companies should disclose plans\\xa0for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy.\\nA core indicator of company alignment with the Paris Agreement is Indicator 1 of the Benchmark, titled “Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050 (or sooner) ambition” (Net Zero Indicator), which seeks disclosure on whether the company has set an ambition to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and whether such ambition explicitly includes scopes 1, 2, and relevant scope 3 (including product) emissions.\\nWhile Boeing has targets to reduce scope 1 & 2 emissions 55% by 2030 on core sites, and has committed to achieve carbon neutrality on some aspects of its business (scopes 1 and 2, and business travel) through the purchase of carbon offsets, it has not reported an ambition to reduce its scope 3 product emissions – constituting 99% of its total emissions – which is a critical gauge of whether and how the Company is reducing climate risk and capitalizing on low carbon opportunities.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board issue a report, at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information, evaluating and disclosing if and how the company has met the criteria of the Net Zero Indicator, including scope 3 use of product emissions, or whether it intends to revise its policies to be fully responsive to such Indicator.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponents suggest, at Company discretion, the report also include any rationale for a decision not to set and disclose goals in line with the Net Zero Indicator.\\n',\n",

Therefore, shareholders support oil and gas companies to change course by aligning their targets with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement and investing accordingly.\\nMore and more investors understand this support to be part of their fiduciary duty to protect all their assets in the global economy from devastating climate change.\\nThis fiduciary duty is underpinned by established scientific consensus, growing investor concern, and heightened legal risk.\\nScientific consensus\\nThe science is clear. We are truly running out of time; we need deep cuts in emissions this decade.\\nTo address the climate crisis and limit warming to 1.5°C, both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that (net) absolute emissions must be reduced by approximately 40% by 2030.1\\nThe IPCC could not be more clear: “unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5°C or even 2°C will be beyond reach”.2\\nThe IEA underlined that “There is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply in our net zero pathway”.3\\nMomentum among financial institutions\\nA growing understanding has emerged among global financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk; therefore, limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.\\nBacking from investors that insist on targets for all emissions continues to gain momentum: 2021 saw unprecedented investor support for climate resolutions. In the US, three climate resolutions passed with a historic majority. In Europe, support for climate resolutions continues to build, despite the companies’ boards rejecting the climate resolutions by claiming their existing climate targets are sufficient:\\nEvidently, a growing group of investors insists on unambiguous Paris-consistent targets for all emissions, especially across the energy sector.\\nLegal risks\\nThere has been a marked increase in climate-based litigation; courts will be more likely to hold those who have made the most significant contributions to climate change to account.\\nIn 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to reduce their worldwide emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 45% by 2030. This indicates that oil and gas companies may have an individual legal responsibility to reduce emissions to address climate change and confirms the risk of liability, including liability for human rights violations.\\nAs such, climate litigation constitutes a significant material risk for the company and its investors; taking the necessary steps now will mitigate this risk and limit future liability.\\nNet zero and the carbon budget\\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world can release another 400 GtCO2 (carbon budget).4 Current global emissions are estimated at 40 GtCO2 per year.5 Therefore, without cuts in emissions, our entire carbon budget to stay within 1.5°C will be exceeded by 2030.\\nThese numbers stress that ‘net zero by 2050’ is inadequate without “immediate, rapid and largescale” emissions reductions.\\nConcluding\\nTo allow maximum flexibility, the company may use whatever metric they deem best suited to set Paris-consistent emissions reductions targets, as long as they lead to absolute emissions reductions consistent with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.\\nWe have welcomed the climate ambitions and targets the company has set thus far, especially assuming responsibility for the emissions of its products (Scope 3). We further welcomed the company’s ‘net-zero by 2050’ aspiration. We thank the shareholders that supported these crucial steps by voting for climate targets resolutions in previous years.\\nWe believe that the company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with the global intergovernmental consensus specified by the Paris Climate Agreement.\\nYou have our support.\\n1\\xa0IEA Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, 2021, page 26;\\xa0IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group I, Summary for Policymakers, 2021, page 13, Box SPM.1 (a), scenario SSP1-1.9\\n2 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report\\xa0Press Release, 9 August 2021.\\xa0\\n3 IEA Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, 2021, page 21.\\n4 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, Summary for Policymakers, 2021, page 29, Table SPM.2 (1.5°C with a 67% likelihood). 5 Idem, page 13, Box SPM.1 (a).\\n',\n",

It can also help companies attract and retain talent, build brand and reputational value, and better manage a rapidly developing regulatory landscape.\\nThe rapid uptake of ESG reporting among publicly traded companies reflects the growing acknowledgement of the material benefits afforded by enhanced disclosure and management of key sustainability issues.

Over 402,000 acres are protected in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest refuge in the eastern United States and home to hundreds of plant and animal species. Moreover, the Okefenokee is the largest freshwater peat deposit in the Northern Hemisphere’s subtropical zone, storing the equivalent of 95 million tons of carbon dioxide.\\nTwin Pines Minerals, LLC has applied for permits to mine titanium next to the Okefenokee, and there has been evidence of Chemours’ interest in buying this project (“the Project”) following permit issuance. Pursuit of such mining or procurement of materials mined there could expose Chemours to considerable material financial risk:\\nClimate and Biodiversity: Federal government scientists have raised concerns that the Project would lower the swamp’s water level, causing serious damage to the ecology and wildlife habitat. This would also dry out the peat beds to greater depths, promoting the spread of catastrophic fire. Were Chemours to mine or purchase titanium mined near the Okefenokee, the company’s scope 3 emissions would dramatically increase in the event of a major fire. The carbon stored in the Okefenokee is equivalent to 68% of the Company’s 2020 scope 3 emissions, and 15 times its combined scope 1 and 2 emissions. Accordingly, any involvement with titanium mining near the Okefenokee would conflict with Chemours’ stated aspiration to reduce its scope 3 emissions, while also exacerbating the business performance and operational risks associated with climate change cited in Chemours’ 2020 10-K.\\nRegulatory and Legal: The outlook for the Project and other development near the Okefenokee is uncertain, as the Biden administration may restore protections for wetlands eliminated under the Trump administration’s wetland rule, which has been overturned by two federal judges. Any developments could therefore become stranded assets and expose Chemours to litigation risk.\\nReputational: Campaigns challenging the Project have generated over 100,000 comments to permitting agencies and significant media attention, including coverage from the\\xa0Washington Post\\xa0and NPR. A group of 120 religious leaders and two former cabinet secretaries have also voiced their opposition. The attention garnered by a 1998 DuPont shareholder proposal regarding similar titanium mining plans next to the Okefenokee helped persuade DuPont to abandon its project and commit to never mine in the area. A reversal by Chemours, DuPont’s corporate successor, would heighten the reputational risk to the company.\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors issue a public report, within a reasonable time, assessing the benefits and drawbacks of committing not to engage in titanium mining, nor to purchase titanium mined by others, near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, and assessing the financial and reputational risks to the company associated with such development or procurement.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Liquid Natural Gas' 'Scope Three' (end-to-end, or life-cycle) carbon emissions are 0.61-0.84 tonnes of carbon equivalent per megawatt hour of electricity produced, according to the US Department of Energy. The number includes upstream mining, fugitive emissions, pipelining, liquefying, shipping, regasifying, final-mile power plant delivery and combustion for electricity. Coal's comparable Scope Three emissions are 1.0-1 .1 tonnes per megawatt hour, according to the department. Wind's Scope Three emissions are around 0.040 tonnes per megawatt hour while solar's are around 0.012 tonnes per megawatt-hour, according to financial adviser and asset manager Lazard. Cheniere provides customers Scope Two emissions data for its Liquid Natural Gas exports. Investors also will benefit from provision of estimated Scope Three emissions data and its future cost implications given these emissions are 25-100 times higher than wind or solar. The International Monetary Fund estimates market or administratively equivalent carbon prices of $70 (or higher) by 2030 are necessary to meet the Paris Climate Accord's 2050 2c targets. The International Energy Agency estimates $140 per tonne is needed to achieve its Sustainable Development Scenario. Applying such prices to Liquid Natural Gas' Scope Three emissions adds $4-$9 per megawatt-hour to electricity produced. That is higher than the entire carbon-adjusted cost per megawatt-hour of wind or solar. The above suggests longevity challenges for Liquid Natural Gas. Investors need to hear more about this from management as financial, regulatory and investment trends drive energy markets toward achievement of mid-century net zero targets. Analysis also could address issues like long lead times, slipping commission dates and ballooning cost overruns common to Liquid Natural Gas projects but not generally shared by falling cost, rapid to deploy wind and solar. However, it could also point out wind and solar face intermittency and storage problems natural gas does not.

Despite contributing to EP enhancements in 2019 after its failure to respect Indigenous Rights as a lead financier of the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL), Citigroup is providing over $5 billion in financing for the Enbridge Line 3 tar sands pipeline expansion “Line 3”.4\\nSimilar to DAPL, Line 3 poses significant risks to the land, water, and cultural rights of several Anishinaabe tribes. The expansion violates numerous rights of Indigenous Peoples as protected by international law, including the rights to free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC); health; culture; religion; security; and assembly.5 In particular, Line 3 threatens access to and health of manoomin, or wild rice, which is central to the survival of Anishinaabe culture.6 The pipeline, with estimated emissions equivalent to 50 coal plants, significantly contributes to climate change, disparately affecting Tribes.7 Enbridge and its partners have consistently failed to meet the international standard of FPIC as well as domestic standards of consultation with the Anishinaabe.8\\nIn response to protests against DAPL at Citigroup’s 2017 annual meeting, the former board chairman wished Citigroup “could have a do-over on this.”9 Line 3 presents similar material risks as DAPL, which was estimated to incur over $7.5 billion in costs due to material social risks.10 Line 3 has a history of ruptures and spills, most recently spilling approximately 10,000 gallons of\\xa0drilling fluid between July and August 2021.11 The project has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, including challenges to the Clean Water Act permit and tribal court litigation on the natural rights of manoomin. 12 Furthermore, militarized response to protests and alleged violation of constitutional rights exposes Citigroup to reputational and litigation risk.13 Enbridge has reimbursed U.S. law enforcement over $2 million for policing protests against the construction of Line 3.14 There have been over 900 arrests, citations, and charges levied against Water Protectors, as well as harassment, surveillance,15 instances of sex trafficking, and violence against women.16\\n1\\xa0https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenouspeoples.html ; https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314\\n2\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attachedfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf\\n3\\xa0https://www.citigroup.com/citi/sustainability/evolution.htm\\n4\\xa0https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Briefing_Line3_KXL.pdf\\n5\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attached-files/cerd_request_line_3_pipeline.pdf\\n6\\xa0https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a3c10abebafb5c4b3293ac/t/5bea2acc89858370442dec08/1542073 038236/fa%20ctsheet+TREATY+RIGHTS.pdf\\n7 https://mn350.org/giant-step-backward/\\n8\\xa0https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CERD_ALE_USA_9448_E.pdf\\n9\\xa0https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup-shareholder-meeting/citi-meeting-protest-prompts-apology-onpipeline-finance-steps-idUSKBN17R20Y\\n10\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attachedfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf\\n11\\xa0https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/08/16/enbridge-line-3-drilling-fluid-spills-what-we-know-so-far/\\n12\\xa0https://www.hcn.org/articles/latest-justice-wild-rice-sues-to-stop-oilpipeline#:~:text=It%20declared%20that%20within%20White,%2C%20recovery%2C%20and%20preservati on.%E2%80%9D\\n13\\xa0https://www.promisehumanrights.blog/blog/2021/10/oil-flows-as-lawsuits-continue-over-enbridges-line-3- pipeline\\n14\\xa0https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/05/line-3-pipeline-enbridge-paid-police-arrest-protesters\\n15\\xa0https://theintercept.com/2021/08/07/minnesota-pipeline-line-3-public-records/\\n16\\xa0https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/03/08/shelter-reports-assaults-harassment-linked-to-line-3-pipelineworkers/ ; https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gkpw/four-enbridge-pipeline-workers-linked-to-sex-traffickingminnesota\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors provide a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary and confidential information, outlining how effective Citigroup’s policies, practices, and performance indicators are in respecting internationally recognized human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples’ rights in its existing and proposed general corporate and project financing.\\xa0\\n',\n",

The United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEPFI), which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible net zero commitments of financial institutions, including: “A financial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should begin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of IPCC 1.5°C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible….All no/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in fossil fuels, signaling that investment in new fossil fuel development is not aligned with 1.5°C.”2 The International Energy Agency (IEA) has concluded, “There is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply in our net zero pathway.” 3 Citigroup has not committed to end funding of fossil fuel expansion. It reportedly recently financed an expanding coal operation in Russia. In September 2021 Bloomberg reported that Russia’s largest coal producer and coal plant operator, JSC SUEK, had mandated nine banks, including Citigroup, for a bond issuance with a 5-year maturity. 4 JSC SUEK produces over 100 million tons of coal per year. It is expanding coal mining operations for an additional 25 million tons per year. SUEK’s coal exports are set for expansion by around 28 million tons per year. An observer noted, \"SUEK plays a central, if not THE central role in Russia’s scheme to profit as much as possible from the coal industry before the fossil era ends. It is outrageous that US and German banks are still helping to raise money for one of the world’s largest coal companies only two months before COP26 in Glasgow.”5 Ernst-Jan Kuiper of BankTrack added: “The participation of US and German banks in this bond issuance is particularly surprising given their net-zero pledges…. we need to see more from\\xa0banks than signing showy net-zero initiatives.\" Financing of new oil and gas exploration and development is also inconsistent with the global goals.

Citigroup is the second-highest financier of companies expanding fossil fuels.5\\nCitigroup faces two associated problems: first, its prominence in asserting climate leadership flies in the face of its actions, creating reputational risk from accusations of greenwashing; second, in underwriting or lending to unneeded projects under the UNEP FI recommendations or IEA NZE scenario, it is loading potentially stranded assets onto its balance sheet or those of its customers.

Nearly half its packaging consists of single use PET plastic bottles, generating 3 million tons of plastic packaging annually, the equivalent of 200,000 bottles per minute.\\nExperts believe actions to reduce single use plastics, including refillable bottle systems, are key to reducing plastic pollution and increasing financial return.\\nThe Company says it operates re-use systems in more than 40 markets, in which glass and plastic beverage bottles are collected, washed, and refilled from 20 to 40 times. Despite the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these programs, in which up to 95% of refillable bottles are collected, only 11% of the Company’s products are currently packaged in refillable glass or plastic bottles, lagging behind other large beverage companies such as Molson Coors, which reports a 61% refillable rate (by weight), and Anheuser Busch InBev, with 35% refillables (by volume). The Company has not publicly committed to increased refillables targets and timelines except in one country – Brazil.\\nSingle use bottles are far more likely to be improperly disposed of and become ocean pollution, harming marine life. Less than 30% of U.S. PET plastic single use bottles are recycled, leaving the vast majority to be landfilled or leaked into the environment. Refillables provide significant opportunities for faster, larger cuts in single use plastic, and carbon footprint reduction benefits as well, since reusable bottles don’t need to be recycled or remade. The company has stated that refillables are among its best packaging options for reducing carbon footprint. Boosting market share of refillables by 10% in coastal countries in place of single use bottles could reduce plastic pollution by 22%, and a 20% increase could cut pollution by 39%, according to a study by environmental group Oceana.\\nThe growing plastic pollution problem will be more economically challenging for companies that are not investing adequately in alternative packaging solutions. Governments are increasingly likely to impose limits or punitive taxes on single use plastic bottles. Germany has put in place refillable bottle requirements. Chile is requiring that 30% of drinks for sale in stores be refillable.\\nWhile the Company has considerable refillable bottle infrastructure already in place, it lacks transparent metrics and uniform reporting on the success of existing programs, as well as goals and deadlines for rapid expansion of these efforts.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors issue a report, within one year, describing the potential to more rapidly reduce dependence on single use plastic packaging by expanding and supporting refillable bottle systems and infrastructure globally. The report should establish uniform companywide metrics for the company's public reporting on refillables use, and evaluate opportunities for setting aggressive refillables goals and deadlines.\\n\",\n",

       " 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report finding that \"rapid, far-reaching” changes are necessary in the next 10 years to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The energy sector has a critical role to play in mitigating climate risks. Already, the sector is undergoing a rapid transition by moving away from coal, but growing reliance on natural gas creates ongoing risk. Natural gas is a major contributor to climate change due to methane leaks and routine combustion emissions.\\nIn 2018, natural gas contributed to an increase in power sector emissions, thereby jeopardizing chances of achieving reductions in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Investing in new gas infrastructure may be uneconomic and result in costly stranded assets comparable to early retirements now occurring for coal. While some low-carbon scenarios show gas use continuing, they rely on carbon removal technologies -- a risky assumption given that the technology has yet to prove economic at scale. Existing alternatives to natural gas -- such as renewables plus storage, demand response, electrification, and energy efficiency -- are all increasingly cost-effective means of serving energy needs while reducing fossil fuel use and climate impacts.\\nCity governments, recognizing gas’ harmful climate impacts, are setting policies prohibiting gas hookups for new buildings in favor of safer, healthier electric buildings. Furthermore, states, cities, and large consumers are setting ambitious renewable energy targets, which utilities will need to supply or risk losing business.\\nWhile Dominion (the Company) is to be commended for taking climate conscious steps, including setting a long term greenhouse gas target and actions to decrease methane leakage, investors lack sufficient information to understand if or how the Company can reconcile its growing reliance on natural gas with aligning with the Glasgow COP26 goals. Even though the Company canceled the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the Company signed onto a contract for capacity from the Mountain Valley Pipeline (an expensive new natural gas infrastructure project still under construction). This is incongruent with the recent pledge that over 100 countries, including the U.S. and China, made to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared to 2020. This indicates that the Company may not be sufficiently addressing commitments for new natural gas infrastructure projects to be reconciled with climate stability goals or the existence of increasingly low cost, clean energy pathways. Peer utilities, including Xcel, have demonstrated alternatives to investing in new gas infrastructure by replacing coal assets with renewables and storage, creating win-win solutions. Shareholders are concerned that the Company is lagging behind on such opportunities and increasing its exposure to climate-related risks by investing in significant gas holdings that may become stranded.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Dominion issue a report at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information describing how it is responding to the risk of stranded assets of planned natural gas based infrastructure and assets as the global response to climate change intensifies.\\n',\n",

       " 'Plastics, with a lifecycle social cost at least\\xa0ten times higher\\xa0than its market price, actively threaten the world’s oceans, wildlife, and public health. Concern about the\\xa0growing scale and impact\\xa0of global plastic pollution has elevated the issue to crisis levels. Of particular concern are\\xa0single-use plastics (SUPs)\\xa0which make up the largest component of the\\xa011 million metric tons of plastic\\xa0ending up in waterways annually. Without drastic action, this amount could\\xa0triple by 2040.\\nIn response to the plastic pollution crisis,\\xa0countries\\xa0and\\xa0major packaging brands\\xa0are beginning to drive reductions in virgin plastic use.\\nSeveral studies demonstrate that a significant\\xa0absolute reduction in virgin plastic demand\\xa0is critical to curbing the flow of plastic into oceans. One of the most robust reduction pathways is presented in the widely-respected report,\\xa0Breaking the Plastic Wave, which found that plastic leakage into the ocean can be feasibly reduced by 80% under its System Change Scenario (SCS), which is based on a\\xa0significant absolute reduction of virgin SUPs.\\xa0\\nBP has recognized the potential disruption that global SUP reductions could have on the oil industry in its\\xa02019 Outlook, where it found a global SUP ban by 2040 would\\xa0reduce oil demand growth by 60%.\\nThe future under the SCS – one built on recycled plastics and circular business models – looks drastically different than today’s linear take-make-waste production model. Several implications of the SCS, including a one-third absolute demand reduction (mostly of virgin SUPs) and immediate reduction of new investment in virgin production, are at odds with\\xa0Exxon’s planned investments.\\nExxon was recently identified as\\xa0the largest global producer of SUP-bound polymers\\xa0(5.9 million metric tons in 2019, an estimated 50% of its total polymer production) and exposed for\\xa0lobbying against plastic pollution laws. While Exxon states it is acting to “address plastic waste,” it fails to meaningfully address the potential for regulatory restrictions and/or significant disruption in demand for virgin plastic, both of which could\\xa0result in stranded assets.\\n\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Exxon’s Board issue an audited report addressing whether and how a significant reduction in virgin plastic demand, as set forth in\\xa0Breaking the Plastic Wave’s System Change Scenario to reduce ocean plastic pollution, would affect the Company’s financial position and assumptions underlying its financial statements. The report should be at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponents recommend that, in the Board’s discretion, the report include:\\nQuantification (in tons and/or as a percentage of total) of the company’s polymer production for SUP markets;\\nA summary or list of the company’s existing and planned investments that may be materially impacted by the SCS;\\nAny future plans or goals to shift its business model from virgin to recycled plastics.\\n',\n",
       " 'Exxon, in 2019, signed a “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” committing the Company to all stakeholders, including “protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainability practices across our businesses.”\\nInconsistent with this “embrace” of sustainability, Exxon lacks a business strategy consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with no commitment to Net Zero by 2050 or a roadmap to get there. Importantly, current 2025 emission targets ignore the Scope 3 emissions of their products, which account for 83 percent of total emissions.\\nA global transition towards a low carbon economy places unprecedented risk on oil companies and the economy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns oil industry emissions need to drop 50 to 90 percent by 2050 to avoid catastrophic consequences. The United States’ Commodity Futures Trading Commission stresses “climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy”. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative reports in “Universal Ownership” that 50 percent of companies’ earnings are at risk from climate costs, creating systemic risk for Exxon, and diversified investors alike.\\nA failure to plan for this transition may place investor capital at substantial risk. The CEOs of Shell, Equinor, and BP predict peak oil demand may occur by 2025. Carbon Tracker reports Exxon could lose 80 percent of its petroleum investments if the world takes action to limit global temperature rise.\\nPeers have begun investing in clean energy, including wind, solar, and renewables storage, while Exxon has invested in less effective carbon mitigation solutions like carbon capture and sequestration. The World Benchmarking Alliance reports companies need to dedicate 77 percent of capital expenditure to low carbon projects to meet a 1.5 degree scenario. Yet, Exxon plans to invest a fraction of that amount—only 3.3 percent—in “lower emission energy solutions” through 2025.\\nExxon’s current strategy has not benefited its stock price for a decade, with the stock price falling approximately negative 20 percent, compared to a near tripling of the S&P 500. Exxon’s returns remain at risk in the absence of a comprehensive climate strategy.\\n\\nResolved:\\nWith board oversight, shareholders request ExxonMobil issue a report (at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information) describing how the company could alter its business model to yield profits within the limits of a 1.5 degree Celsius global temperature rise by substantially reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nThe proponent suggests such a report could include a roadmap (with timelines, short and long term goals, capital expenditure planning) to alter its energy mix to reduce fossil fuel dependence, including options such as buying, or merging with, companies with renewable energy assets or technologies, and/or internally expanding its renewable energy portfolio, and/or exercising stricter capital discipline by focusing on high return, low cost, and low carbon capital expenditures to boost return on capital, reduce societal greenhouse gas emissions, and protect shareholder value.\\n',\n",

Therefore shareholders support oil and gas companies to substantially reduce their emissions.\\nWe, the shareholders, understand this support to be essential in protecting all our assets in the global economy from devastating climate change.\\nWe therefore support the Company to set emission reduction targets for all emissions: the emissions of the company’s operations and the emissions of its energy products (Scope 1, 2, and 3). Reducing Scope 3 emissions, the vast majority, is essential to limiting global heating.\\nScientific consensus\\nThe world’s leading international scientific bodies recently released reports which clearly state the need for deep cuts in emissions in order to limit global warming to safe levels.\\nFinancial momentum\\nA growing international consensus has emerged among financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.\\nBacking from investors that insist on targets for all emissions continues to gain momentum: 2021 saw unprecedented investor support for climate resolutions. In the US, three of these climate resolutions passed with a historic majority. In Europe, support for these climate resolutions continued to build.\\nLegal risk\\nIn 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to severely reduce their worldwide emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 2030. This indicates that oil majors and large investors have an individual legal responsibility to combat dangerous climate change by reducing emissions and confirms the risk of liability.\\nWe believe that the Company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with curbing climate change.\\nYou have our support.\\n',\n",

This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAs long-term Exxon shareholders, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. A company’s reputation, value, and bottom line can be adversely impacted by election spending that is conducted blindly.\\nThe Conference Board’s 2021 Under a Microscope report1 details these risks, recommends the process suggested in this proposal, and warns a new era of stakeholder scrutiny, social media, and political polarization has propelled corporate political activity – and the risks that come with it – into the spotlight. Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies, including the perception that political contributions – and other forms of activity – are at odds with core company values.\\nExxon discloses some election related spending, but it does not disclose direct independent expenditures, payments to influence the outcome of ballot measures, or payments to trade associations or 501(c)(4) organizations that could be used for election-related purposes.\\nPublicly available records show Exxon has contributed nearly $20 million in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle.\\nBut information on indirect electoral spending through trade associations and 501(c)(4) groups cannot be obtained by shareholders unless the Company discloses it. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, direct and indirect. This would bring our company in line with leading companies, including AT&T, Phillips 66, and ConocoPhillips.\\nWe believe Exxon’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when the candidates supported by its election spending contradict company public positions or take controversial positions. For example, Exxon supports federal tax policies to address climate change, yet many of the candidates supported by its trade associations speak out against climate action and even question the scientific consensus on climate change.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Investors are concerned that the continued development of new fossil fuel resources increases the risk of such future impairments. ExxonMobil’s existing, audited annual disclosures do not provide investors with sufficient insight into stranded asset risk related to the energy transition. “If climate change impacts the entity, the auditor needs to consider whether the financial statements appropriately reflect this,” according to the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\\nAn independent September 2021 analysis\\xa0concluded that the financial statements of ExxonMobil lack the requisite transparency about climate-related assumptions and estimates, and company disclosures do not appear to use Paris-aligned assumptions and estimates. In contrast, peers (Royal Dutch Shell, bp, TotalEnergies) released more transparent disclosures in their audited financial statements, articulating the extent of consideration of climate change contingencies and risks.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that ExxonMobil's Board of Directors seek an audited report assessing how applying the assumptions of the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 pathway would affect the assumptions, costs, estimates, and valuations underlying its financial statements, including those related to long-term commodity and carbon prices, remaining asset lives, future asset retirement obligations, capital expenditures and impairments. The Board should obtain and ensure publication of the report by February 2023, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nThe proponent recommends the requested report be supported with reasonable assurance from an independent auditor.\\nInvestors with $103 trillion\\xa0in assets under management have already called for companies and their auditors to rigorously disclose climate risks in financial reporting, or risk overstatement by failing to integrate impacts on profits and financial positions.6\\nLast year, this topic received 49.4% support of ExxonMobil investors.

       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders request that Meta Platforms Inc.’s (“Meta’s”) Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue a report (at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information) describing if, and how, its lobbying activities (directly, and indirectly through trade associations and social welfare and nonprofit organizations) align with the Paris Agreement’s ultimate goal of limiting average global warming to 1.5° Celsius. The report should also address Meta’s actions to mitigate the risks presented by any misalignment found.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nRecent UN reports highlight the critical gaps that remain between national governments’ commitments and the actions necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change.1 Companies have a crucial role to play in empowering policymakers to close these gaps, and investors need clear information on how companies are taking action to do so. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing the potential misalignment between companies’ climate commitments and their policy advocacy.2 Corporate lobbying activities inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational, and legal risks. Further, significant delays in substantially cutting greenhouse gas emissions and readying societies for future climate impacts will increase the likelihood for systemic risks to the global economy. 3 4 5 6 Unabated climate change characterized by “business as usual” scenarios of 3°C or greater will have unacceptable and far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal implications. As investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s goals as an economic imperative. Of particular concern, therefore, are industry and policy groups that represent businesses like Meta, but too often create barriers that impede global emissions reductions. A review of Meta’s disclosed trade association and other memberships7 reveals concerning inconsistencies with Meta’s actions on, and commitments to, the Paris Agreement and the prevailing science. 8 9 10 Meta further supports the direction of some of these potentially misaligned organizations by serving on their boards.Meta says it “chose these organizations because they are engaged in meaningful dialogue about either the internet or the local communities in which we operate. While we actively participate in these discussions ... we do not always agree with every policy or position that individual organizations or their leadership take. Therefore, our membership, work with organizations, or event support should not be viewed as an endorsement,” notes Meta’s public policy guidelines.12 Assessing Meta’s climate lobbying alignment across its businesses and articulating clear action to address any misalignment further protects the credibility of Meta’s leadership efforts on climate change, including its renewable energy and emissions goals. We therefore urge the Board to conduct a comprehensive review of Meta’s lobbying and public policy activity and partnerships, assessing the climate policy activities of these relationships with the Paris Agreement’s objectives, and detailing clear plans for action to address any found misalignment.\\n',\n",

Her testimony highlighted the Company’s prioritization of its profits over social and environmental systems that undergird our economy and the wellbeing of its users: I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.1 The Company reached 3,210,000,000 users in the third quarter of 2020.2 Its platforms affects users’ perceptions, and these perceptions affect social institutions and the ability of the global community to address potentially catastrophic threats. As one expert bluntly stated: Facebook is becoming the last bastion of climate denial.3 Company personnel know its content is harmful: • We know that COVID vaccine hesitancy has the potential to cause severe societal harm.4 • We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.5 But a former employee says the Company accepts those harms to increase its profits: The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes because they put their astronomical profits before people…6 These harms matter to shareholders, most of whom diversify their investments to optimize return. Diversified shareholders lose when companies harm the economy, because the value of a diversified portfolio rises and falls with GDP.7 While the Company may profit by inflicting social costs, its diversified shareholders pay the bill. In contrast, our CEO is not diversified. His wealth is concentrated in Company shares: unlike most shareholders, his investments do not absorb the social costs the company creates. We ask the Company for a report identifying and analyzing areas where the Company’s practice of maximizing its own financial returns is opposed to the interests of its diversified shareholders in a healthy economy. This will help shareholders understand where the Company’s prioritization of “astronomical profits before people” creates a financial risk to their portfolios. Such a report would not need to provide precise numbers: identifying areas where the Company creates systemic risk—as internal Company documents already do-- and analyzing how those risks might manifest as economic costs that threaten diversified portfolios would highly useful to shareholders.\\n',\n",

The United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible net zero commitments of financial institutions, including: “A financial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should begin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of IPCC 1.5°C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible….All no/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in fossil fuels, signalling that investment in new fossil fuel development is not aligned with 1.5°C.”3\\xa0Another of the world’s most credible sources, the\\xa0International Energy Agency (IEA), in its\\xa0Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), states that “no fossil fuel exploration is required and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development.”4\\xa0Goldman has restricted financing for new coal operations and Arctic drilling, but has no policy to halt financing any new oil and gas exploration and development. Goldman is the six-highest U.S. financier or facilitator of companies expanding fossil fuels, according to the Banking on Climate Chaos report.5\\xa0\\nGoldman faces two associated problems: first, its prominence in asserting climate leadership flies in the face of its actions, creating reputational risk from accusations of greenwashing; second, in underwriting projects which are unneeded under the UNEP FI recommendations or IEA NZE scenario, it is knowingly loading potentially stranded assets onto its clients’ balance sheets, creating litigation risk.6\\xa0In this regard, investors need to know that Goldman’s lending and underwriting policies are consistent with its own net zero commitment.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\ufeff1 Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K, at 43.\\xa0\\n2 https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-NZBA-Commitment-Statement.pdf\\xa0\\n3 https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-UNEP-FI.-Recommendations-for-Credible-Net-Zero-Commitments.pdf, at 15.\\xa0\\n4 https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/88dec0c7-3a11-4d3b-99dc-8323ebfb388b/WorldEnergyOutlook2021.pdf, at 100.\\xa0\\n5 https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf, at 38.\\n',\n",

Boreal forests stabilize the climate and harbor biodiversity, holding approximately 44 percent of all terrestrial carbon. Canada’s boreal, which constitutes 25 percent of the world’s remaining intact forest and stores twice as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests, experiences the third highest rate of intact forest loss globally, releasing tens of millions of metric tons of carbon annually. Demand for wood products is a primary driver of Canadian forest clearance.

Under current emission trajectories, 10% of total global economic value has been estimated to be lost by 2050.3 Limiting warming to 1.5 versus 2 degrees could save $20 trillion globally by 2100; exceeding 2 degrees could lead to climate damages in the hundreds of trillions.\\nTo diversified investors, continued support for fossil fuel development threatens long- term portfolio value; for banks, it means increased credit, market, and operational risks.4 Even short-term fossil fuel financing contributes to long-term risk: the IPCC’s 2021 report confirmed that historic and current emissions have locked in warming for the next two decades.5\\nIn May 2021, JPMC released 2030 targets for oil and gas, electric power and autos as part of its “Paris-aligned financing commitment”. The bank’s 2030 targets specify reductions in carbon intensity — that is, greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output.\\nThese targets are compatible with expansion of fossil fuels. The intensity targets do not meet the identified need, over the next decade, to cut global absolute emissions by 45%. JPMC has been identified as the largest funder of companies expanding oil and gas production.6 Some of these oil and gas companies have set intensity reduction targets meeting or exceeding what JPMC is calling for, even as they plan continued oil and gas expansion.\\nPublic calls for an end to fossil fuel finance have grown and threaten JPMC’s reputation. For example, in September 2021, JPMC and other large banks were named in an op-ed by youth climate activists calling on the banks to stop financing expansion of fossil fuels.7\\nWe urge shareholders to vote in favor of this proposal, to encourage JPMorgan Chase align with global efforts to contain climate change.\\n\\n1\\xa0https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210513005492/en/JPMorgan-Chase-Releases-Carbon- Reduction-Targets-for-Paris-Aligned-Financing-Commitment\\n2\\xa0https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\\xa0p 21\\n3\\xa0https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe- risk/expertise-publication-economics-of-climate-change.html\\n4\\xa0https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/climate-change-risk-banks\\n5\\xa0https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html\\n6\\xa0https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/\\n7\\xa0https://www.teenvogue.com/story/banks-fund-fossil-fuels\\n',\n",

(“JPM”), in light of the ongoing climate crisis and to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, end its investment, underwriting, and lending activities in fossil fuels.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nClimate change caused by global warming is a growing threat to humanity and the planet.1 The Federal Reserve has begun to warn that climate-related financial risk is a threat to the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and the stability of the overall financial system.2\\nIn order to avoid the worst climate impacts and still maintain a livable climate, the global temperature rise needs to be limited to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.3 As set out in the Paris Agreement, this goal requires net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050.4 However, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, a recent scientific study showed that the use of oil and gas must decrease annually by 3% until 2050 and that many planned and operational fossil fuel projects therefore will be unviable.5\\nEveryone has a role in climate change, and banks in particular play a critical role in helping to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Banks can either be enablers for fossil fuel pollution by providing the world’s largest GHG emitters with funding to extract more fossil fuels, or they can be powerful levers used to compel these same companies to cut emissions and prepare responsibly for a greener future.6\\nHowever, since the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, at least $3.8 trillion has been invested in fossil fuels by sixty banks, with JPM emerging shamefully as the largest fossil fuel financier in the world.7 According to Bloomberg data, JPM earned an estimated $900 million in fees from arranging loans and bond sales since the beginning of 2016 – this is 40% more than Bank of America and 60% more than Wells Fargo.8\\nWhile JPM recently announced that it would finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion to address climate change over the next decade, with $1 trillion earmarked for green initiatives such as clean technologies,9 JPM has yet to commit to actually end its fossil fuel-related activities. Fossil fuel divestment is a key strategy to combat climate change, as it can reduce new capital\\xa0flows into the fossil fuel industry10 and help reduce global fossil fuel consumption.11 It also sends a clear signal that companies need to prepare for a greener and more sustainable future. If JPM were to divest, other banks would likely follow – creating a race to move away from dirty fossil fuels and towards more sustainable alternatives.\\nAs the largest fossil fuel financier in the world, JPM enables and encourages fossil fuel pollution, which has a broad societal impact. Its continued fossil fuel activities, including their sheer scale, also place the company and its shareholders at risk.\\xa0\\n1\\xa0https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/\\n2\\xa0https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/february/climate-change-is-source-of-financial-risk/\\n3\\xa0https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change\\n4\\xa0https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\\n5\\xa0https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8\\n6\\xa0https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/banks-produce-700-times-more-emissions-from-loans-than-offices\\n7\\xa0https://reclaimfinance.org/site/wp content/uploads/2021/03/BOCC__2021_vF.pdf\\n8\\xa0https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/jpmorgan-tops-banks-supporting-fossil-fuel-and-signals-green-shift\\n9\\xa0https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000019617/000001961721000292/jpm-20210331.htm\\n10\\xa0https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/21/1/141/6042790 11 https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/reports/SAP-divestment-report-final.pdf\\n',\n",

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent “Emissions Gap Report” from the United Nations Environment Programme (October 26, 2021), critical gaps remain between the commitments of national governments and the actions necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policymakers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels present regulatory, reputational, and legal risks to companies. Such policy engagement also presents systemic risks to economies and markets, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, undermine economic stability, and introduce into investment portfolios uncertainty and volatility. We believe Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps mitigate these risks and contributes positively to the long-term value of companies.\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis. When a company presents itself as a proponent of climate action but funds organizations that work against policy solutions, it exposes itself to potential reputational damage, especially in this age of social media.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C—as an imperative. We remain convinced that unabated climate change characterized by “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater will have unacceptable and far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal implications.\\nJPMorgan Chase presently provides insufficient information to demonstrate how our company works to ensure its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals, and what management and the board do to address misalignments. While the company publicly discloses a list of its trade association memberships, it does not discuss any direct engagement with them on climate change, their climate policy positions, its role within each association, nor does the company disclose any actions taken in the event of misalignments on climate policy. For instance, JPMorgan Chase is a member of the US Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable which have a history of actively and negatively lobbying on US climate policy.\\nThus, we urge the Board and management to assess the company’s lobbying on climate policy and report to shareholders.\\xa0\\n',\n",

It has committed to align with pathways consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to use decarbonization scenarios from “credible and well- recognized sources.”2\\nHowever, JPMorgan’s current decarbonization plan is not aligned with a credible net zero pathway. The UNEP FI, which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible net zero commitments of financial institutions.3 UNEP FI contrasts two decarbonization approaches: “absolute contraction,” or “[r]educing the absolute amount of carbon in the portfolio,” versus an “[e]conomic intensity-based” approach, or “[a]chieving a greater carbon efficiency per dollar invested.” While JPMorgan publishes decarbonization targets based on carbon efficiency, UNEP FI emphasizes “it is most convincing for investors to use an absolute contraction approach (original emphasis)...”4 Targeting portfolio carbon efficiency by itself, without adopting absolute greenhouse gas emission reduction standards for its financing, allows for an increase in the Company’s total fossil fuel financing. For example, focusing on only lower carbon intensity fuels, such as fracked gas, decreases overall portfolio intensity while potentially increasing its overall financed emissions.\\nThis is a red flag for JPMorgan, the world’s top financier of companies expanding fossil fuels.5 The UNEP FI recommendations also admonish: “A financial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should begin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of IPCC 1.5°C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible....All no/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in fossil fuels, signaling that investment in new fossil fuel development is not aligned with 1.5°C.”6 JPMorgan has no policy to halt financing new oil and gas exploration and development.\\nJPMorgan’s assertions of climate leadership fly in the face of its actions, creating reputational risk from greenwashing accusations. By underwriting or lending to projects which are unneeded under the UNEP FI recommendations, JPMorgan is also knowingly loading potentially stranded assets onto its clients’ balance sheets, or its own, creating financial and litigation risk.7 In this regard, investors need to know that JPMorgan’s emissions reduction targets, and its lending and underwriting policies, are consistent with its own net zero commitment.\\n1 JPMorgan Chase 2020 Form 10-K, at 28.\\n2\\xa0https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-NZBA-Commitment- Statement.pdf\\n3\\xa0https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-UNEP-FI.-Recommendations-for-Credible-Net- Zero-Commitments.pdf\\n4 Id.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 26), world leaders signed the Declaration on Forests and Land Use committing to end forest loss and land degradation by 2030.[1]\\nClimate change poses environmental and social harms and presents significant risks to food companies and their supply chains. As it worsens, it will exacerbate biodiversity loss, ecosystem instability, and threaten global access to food.\\nCompanies must act rapidly to reduce emissions in line with science-based goals, as recent studies show that limiting warming below 1.5°C is now “extremely unlikely.” According to the IPCC, agriculture, forestry, and other land use change is responsible for 23 percent of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, nearly half of which is attributable to deforestation. The majority of these emissions are embedded in the production of key agricultural commodities, and fall under scope 3, or indirect, emissions from the supply chain for companies that source, manufacture, distribute, and sell agricultural or food products.

Corporations could face an\\xa0annual financial risk of approximately $100 billion\\xa0should governments require them to cover the waste management costs of the packaging they produce, a policy that is increasingly being enacted around the globe.\\nRecently, Pew Charitable Trusts released a groundbreaking study,\\xa0Breaking the Plastic Wave, concluding that if all current industry and government commitments were met, ocean plastic deposition would be reduced by only seven percent. Without immediate and sustained new commitments throughout the plastics value chain, annual flows of plastics into oceans could nearly triple by 2040.\\nThe Pew report also finds that improved recycling is insufficient to stem the plastic tide, and must be coupled with reductions in use, materials redesign, and substitution. It also finds that at least one-third of plastic demand can and should be reduced. The report states that reducing plastic production is the most attractive solution from environmental, economic, and social perspectives. The European Union has banned 10 single-use plastic products commonly found in ocean cleanups and enacted a $1/kg tax on non-recycled plastic packaging waste.\\nKraft Heinz lags peers in reducing risk from plastic packaging use. Competitor Unilever has taken the most significant action to date, agreeing to cut virgin plastic packaging use by 50% by 2025, including absolute elimination of 100,000 tons of plastic packaging. Seventeen other consumer goods companies have virgin plastic reduction goals, including Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Nestlé, and Target. Kraft Heinz has no virgin plastic reduction goal.\\nCompetitor Nestlé uses 4.2% recycled content in its plastic packaging, while fifteen other companies report using two to ten percent recycled content plastic. Twenty-three competitors have time bound goals to improve use of recycled content plastic in packaging. Kraft Heinz does not report use of any recycled content plastic and has no recycled plastic content goal.\\nUp to 30% of Kraft Heinz’s packaging is flexible plastic film, which cannot be recycled. Flexible packaging represents 59% of all plastic production but an outsized 80% of plastic leaking into oceans.\\nOur company\\xa0received a score of “D”\\xa0in a 2021 study ranking corporate leadership on plastic pollution, demonstrating that Kraft Heinz is behind competitors in addressing its contribution to plastic pollution, thereby creating reputational, regulatory, and cost risks.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Kraft Heinz Board issue a report describing how the company will reduce plastic packaging, including any planned reduction strategies or goals, materials redesign, substitution, or reductions in use of virgin plastic.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponents note that the report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting confidential information, and include an assessment of the reputational, financial, and operational risks associated with continuing to use substantial amounts of plastic packaging while plastic pollution grows unabated.

Competition for water, weak regulation, growing demands, aging infrastructure, water scarcity and water contamination are all sources of material financial risks for companies.\\nClimate change exacerbates these risks. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change August 2021 report, climate change is intensifying the water cycle, resulting in more intense droughts and rainfall linked to flooding. The TCFD recommends water risk disclosure saying: “Organizations’ financial performance may also be affected by changes in water availability, sourcing, and quality; food security...”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo identify water risk and reduce costs, many companies - including Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellogg Company, Nestlé, and Unilever - conduct water risk assessments for both operations and supply chains. However, Kraft Heinz conducts a water risk assessment only for direct operations. The company claims in its 2020 ESG Report that it is “committed to water stewardship in every facet of our business, from our quality controls to the relationships we have with our growers and suppliers.” Despite ranking “Water Use & Conservation” as one of the top issues in its materiality assessment, Kraft Heinz entirely fails to account for the water footprint of its agricultural supply chain, which for food companies often represents a major source of water risk.\\xa0\\xa0\\nKraft Heinz conducted a supply chain risk assessment for human rights but has not disclosed conducting similar assessments for water.

       " 'In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change advised that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius, prevent the worst consequences of climate change, and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, the UN reported that the world is “way off track” in its efforts to achieve these targets. Companies must therefore act rapidly to reduce emissions in line with science-based goals.\\nModeling from PRI’s IPR consortium suggests that deforestation must end in 2025 in order to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. Kroger uses palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, coffee, and wood pulp in its products. These commodities are leading drivers of deforestation, which accounts for roughly 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. While Kroger has adopted a No-Deforestation Commitment, its timeline for achieving this commitment stretches to 2030.\\nIn its 2021 10-K, Kroger acknowledges that climate impacts “may affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities that are optimal for us or at all.”\\nScope 3, or value chain, emissions are likely to represent Kroger’s greatest contribution to climate change. For context, Walmart, a Kroger competitor, discloses that Scope 3 emissions make up 95 percent of its total emissions. However, Kroger has not disclosed its comprehensive Scope 3 emissions, notably omitting emissions from purchased goods and services. Further, Kroger has not set any targets for reducing its Scope 3 emissions. While Kroger has set emissions reduction targets for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, these targets are not aligned with limiting warming to 1.5° Celsius.\\nCompeting retailers, including Walmart, Ahold Delhaize, CVS Health, and Target have set Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reduction targets consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Albertsons and Amazon have also committed to setting emissions reduction targets through SBTi.\\nFailure to keep pace with competitors and anticipate regulatory changes may pose material risks to Kroger, including restricted market share, inability to meet government mandates, and reputational damage.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Kroger adopt near-term and long-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, inclusive of emissions from its full value chain, in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner and to effectuate appropriate emissions reductions prior to 2030.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\n\\xa0In assessing targets, proponents recommend, at management’s discretion:\\n● Consideration of approaches used by advisory groups such as the Science Based Targets initiative;\\n● Adopting emissions reduction targets inclusive of all GHG Protocol-defined sources of Scope 3 emissions—including from agriculture, land use change, and deforestation—that align with limiting temperature increases to 1.5°C;\\n● Increasing the scale, pace, and rigor of initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of Kroger’s supply chain and ensuring a deforestation-free supply chain.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are potent greenhouse gases, with a high global warming potential (GWP) making them hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) in contributing to climate change per unit of mass. Refrigeration systems utilized by Kroger contain HFCs. The Company’s reporting indicates refrigerant emissions may account for 63% of its Scope 1 emissions.\\nKroger has taken steps to reduce refrigerant leakage in its stores. However, refrigerant emissions cannot be eliminated by reducing leaks alone. As long as companies continue to utilize HFCs, there is reason to believe that their production, usage and ultimate disposal will continue to release HFCs to the environment. That is why Kroger’s peers are moving to refrigerants with much lower GWP.\\nThe potential impact on reducing climate change is profound. A recent U.N. report estimates that phasing down HFCs globally will reduce their future warming impact from 0.5° C to less than 0.1° C.1 In fact, scientists have found we must accelerate the global phasedown of HFCs in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° C.2\\nThe Board of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), a group of major consumer goods retailers and manufacturers of which Kroger is a member, approved a 2016 resolution to mobilize resources towards transitioning away from HFCs. The resolution stated that member companies committed to “install new equipment that utilize only natural refrigerants or alternative ultra-low GWP refrigerants effective immediately.”3 The CGF defined “ultra-low GWP” as less than 150. The resolution promised individual targets and action plans toward implementation.\\nKroger’s 2021 ESG report does not reference any strategy for adopting ultra-low GWP technologies. Instead, Kroger’s report specifies GWPs of “1,500 or less.”4\\nKroger lags peers such as ALDI US, which has installed ultra-low GWP refrigeration systems in over 420 stores, and in all new self-contained equipment.5 Target and Whole Foods have also adopted ultra-low GWP technologies more widely than Kroger.6 Negative media attention on HFCs is increasing,7 while peer companies receive a reputational boost.8\\nProactive adoption of ultra-low GWP technologies would not only reduce Scope 1 emissions but may ultimately be more cost-effective, since trends in Europe indicate HFC prices may rise by up to 1300%.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Kroger issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing how it can adopt strategies above and beyond legal compliance to curtail the predominant source of its operational (Scope 1) GHG emissions, by deploying the best available technological options for eliminating the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigeration. The report should describe the extent to which the Company will act consistent with the Consumer Goods Forum commitments on ultra-low GWP refrigerants, including any related capital spending commitments, or explain why the Company is not acting consistent with those commitments.\\n',\n",

The United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible net zero commitments of financial institutions, including: “A financial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should begin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of IPCC 1.5°C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible….All no/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in fossil fuels, signaling that investment in new fossil fuel development is not aligned with 1.5°C.”19 Another of the world’s most credible sources, the International Energy Agency (IEA), in its Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), states that “no fossil fuel exploration is required and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development.”20 Morgan Stanley has restricted financing for new coal operations and Arctic drilling, but has no policy to halt financing any new oil and gas exploration and development.

But while banks make these important changes, they may still be variously enabling pollution-intensive asset privatizations, exposing investors to risk.\\n1\\xa0https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-greenwashing-is-real-as-companies-and-fundsride-the-esg-express-the/\\n2\\xa0https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PESP_SpecialReport_ClimateCrisis_Oct2021_Final.pdf\\n3\\xa0https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-to-sell-alaska-business-to-hilcorp.html\\n4\\xa0https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/contango-conocophillips-us/\\n5\\xa0https://www.catf.us/resource/benchmarking-methane-emissions/\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nThat so as to not facilitate adverse environmental impacts in connection with the sale of coal, oil or gas assets from public companies to private enterprises (pollution-intensive asset privatization), shareholders request RBC and its business units not participate in or enable pollution-intensive asset privatization transactions, specifically by not accepting any new mandates to provide either financing/lending or M&A advisory services to such transactions.\\n',\n",

The Bank is also a signatory to the Equator Principles, which contains provisions to respect Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) by Indigenous Peoples in major projects that affect them.\\nWhile taxonomies and regulations are emerging, what ultimately qualifies as “sustainable finance” is currently decided by RBC. Reputational risk is possible when the public’s expectations do not align with the company’s definitions.\\nOn September 27, 2021 a Toronto Star article referenced RBC as a bank involved in $1.5 billion financing to pipeline company Enbridge, $1.1 billion of which was “sustainability linked.” Critics alleged “greenwashing.”2\\nRegarding the “sustainability-linked” financing, Enbridge stated that it “does not intend to allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria.”3\\nThe investor-led Climate Action 100+, of which RBC Global Asset Management is a signatory, found that Enbridge “does not meet any criteria” in aligning its capital allocations with the Net-Zero Company Benchmark.4\\nAt the time of the financing, Enbridge was completing the Line 3 oil pipeline expansion, a project with the equivalent emissions impact of 50 new coal- fired power plants.5 The Line 3 expansion also failed to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of affected Indigenous Peoples, resulting in court cases, hundreds of arrests, and significant media attention.6\\nNone of the guidelines or frameworks RBC is party to require the Bank’s “sustainable financing” be numerically consistent with its net zero emissions reductions targets, nor do they preclude financing of fossil fuel activity.\\nThe EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities recognizes the risk of carbon lock-in from financing fossil fuel activity, even for pollution abatement, and therefore precludes it.7 Transition finance is reserved for activities for which there are no low-carbon alternatives.\\nIn addition to Line 3, RBC has been involved with financing other major fossil fuel projects that failed to secure FPIC.8 There have been dozens of demonstrations outside RBC branches accusing the bank of failure to respect Indigenous Rights in its financing.9 While RBC should consider strengthening its policy regarding FPIC across all its financing activities, failure to respect Indigenous Rights in financing branded “sustainable” heightens the prospect of reputational risk.\\nWe urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.\\xa0\\n1\\xa0http://www.rbc.com/community-sustainability/_assets-custom/pdf/\\nOurCommitment_EN.PDF\\n2\\xa0https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/09/27/canadian-banks-are- loaning-enbridge-over-1b-with-questionable-sustainability-requirements. html\\n3\\xa0https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/09/27/canadian-banks-are- loaning-enbridge-over-1b-with-questionable-sustainability-requirements. html\\n4\\xa0https://www.climateaction100.org/company/enbridge-inc/\\n5\\xa0http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2020/01/Giant-Step-Backward-\\nreport-01-29-19-FINAL-online-version.pdf\\n6\\xa0https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/protesters-line- 3-minnesota-oil-gas-pipeline\\n7\\xa0https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/ banking_and_finance/documents/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-faq_ en.pdf\\n8\\xa0These include the Trans Mountain pipeline, Coastal Gas Link, and the Dakota Access Pipeline.\\n9\\xa0https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/on-the-eve-of-cop26-stand- earth-joins-people-across-the-country-that-are-unhappy-with-canada- s-largest-bank-rbc-for-its-refusal-to-stop-financing-new-fossil-fuel- projects-800456703.html\\xa0\\n',\n",

While we recognize that the challenge is a sizable one, it does require financial institutions to switch from a linear economy (extract, make, consume, waste) to a model that incorporates the product’s life cycle and sustainable resource management, which can be described using the 3 Rs – reduce, recycle, reuse.1\\nWe draw to your attention the United Nations Environment Programme2 (UNEP), which for several years has pointed to the urgent need for decoupling economic growth from the consumption of virgin resources and environmental impacts, not to mention the unprecedented degradation of ecosystems and the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Note that, worldwide, only slightly less than 9% of extracted resources3 are reintegrated into the economy after their first cycle of use.\\nWe therefore feel it is important that this disclosure be made so that the bank can set its financing objectives for these businesses and report the extent to which these objectives have been achieved in its annual reports.\\n1\\xa0https://group.bnpparibas/actualite/soutenons-economie-circulaire-formes-accelerer-transition\\xa0https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/circular_economy_guide_en.pdf\\n2\\xa0https://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/decoupling-natural-resource-use-and-environmental-impacts-economic- growth\\n3\\xa0https://www.circularity-gap.world/2020\\xa0\\n',\n",

Even more alarming than the final report published in 2014, this draft estimates that no matter the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the devastating consequences of global warming on nature (and humans who depend on it) will accelerate and become painfully obvious well before 2050; as these experts explain,2 “[l]ife on earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems.

Therefore, shareholders support oil and gas companies to change course by aligning their targets with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement and investing accordingly.\\nMore and more investors understand this support to be part of their fiduciary duty to protect all their assets in the global economy from devastating climate change.\\nThis fiduciary duty is underpinned by established scientific consensus, growing investor concern, and heightened legal risk.\\nScientific consensus\\nThe science is clear. We are truly running out of time; we need deep cuts in emissions this decade.\\nTo address the climate crisis and limit warming to 1.5°C, both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that (net) absolute emissions must be reduced by approximately 40% by 2030.1\\nThe IPCC could not be more clear: “unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5°C or even 2°C will be beyond reach”.2\\nThe IEA underlined that “There is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply in our net zero pathway”.3\\nMomentum among financial institutions\\nA growing understanding has emerged among global financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk; therefore, limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.\\nBacking from investors that insist on targets for all emissions continues to gain momentum: 2021 saw unprecedented investor support for climate resolutions. In the US, three climate resolutions passed with a historic majority. In Europe, support for climate resolutions continues to build, despite the companies’ boards rejecting the climate resolutions by claiming their existing climate targets are sufficient:\\nEvidently, a growing group of investors insists on unambiguous Paris-consistent targets for all emissions, especially across the energy sector.\\nLegal risks\\nThere has been a marked increase in climate-based litigation; courts will be more likely to hold those who have made the most significant contributions to climate change to account.\\nIn 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to reduce their worldwide emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 45% by 2030. This indicates that oil and gas companies may have an individual legal responsibility to reduce emissions to address climate change and confirms the risk of liability, including liability for human rights violations.\\nAs such, climate litigation constitutes a significant material risk for the company and its investors; taking the necessary steps now will mitigate this risk and limit future liability.\\nNet zero and the carbon budget\\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world can release another 400 GtCO2 (carbon budget).4 Current global emissions are estimated at 40 GtCO2 per year.5 Therefore, without cuts in emissions, our entire carbon budget to stay within 1.5°C will be exceeded by 2030.\\nThese numbers stress that ‘net zero by 2050’ is inadequate without “immediate, rapid and largescale” emissions reductions.\\nConcluding\\nTo allow maximum flexibility, the company may use whatever metric they deem best suited to set Paris-consistent emissions reductions targets, as long as they lead to absolute emissions reductions consistent with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.\\nWe have welcomed the climate ambitions and targets the company has set thus far, especially assuming responsibility for the emissions of its products (Scope 3). We further welcomed the company’s ‘net-zero by 2050’ aspiration. We thank the shareholders that supported these crucial steps by voting for climate targets resolutions in previous years.\\nWe believe that the company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with the global intergovernmental consensus specified by the Paris Climate Agreement.\\nYou have our support.\\n1\\xa0IEA Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, 2021, page 26;\\xa0IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group I, Summary for Policymakers, 2021, page 13, Box SPM.1 (a), scenario SSP1-1.9\\n2 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report\\xa0Press Release, 9 August 2021.\\xa0\\n3 IEA Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, 2021, page 21.\\n4 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, Summary for Policymakers, 2021, page 29, Table SPM.2 (1.5°C with a 67% likelihood). 5 Idem, page 13, Box SPM.1 (a).\\n',\n",

Due to the short time scales on which S&P assesses risk, this climate reality is largely missing from S&P’s credit ratings - especially in its financial forecasts.\\nOf 2300 ESG rating actions between April and December 2020, environmental factors contributed in only 24.1 Additionally, only credit rating analysts are part of credit rating committees “with potential for non-voting participation of sustainable finance analysts.”2\\nIn 2019 S&P downgraded Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) only after the raging California wildfire led to its bankruptcy.3 Hardly a black swan event, PG&E’s exposure to wildfire risk had been increasing for over 20 years.4 This case is not isolated. In 2021, following the Texas freeze, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative filed for bankruptcy after holding an ‘A’ rating from S&P a week earlier.5 Such ex-post ratings actions and lack of attention to long-term horizons expose flaws in S&P’s climate risk approach.\\nTime horizons for climate change stress testing need to reflect the duration over which climate change risk factors are expected to fully materialize. The Prudential Regulatory Authority of Bank of England highlights that climate-related financial risks will likely grow over time. Longer-term scenario analysis needs to inform strategy and risk assessment.6\\nS&P says forecasts “generally include quantitative information two to three years into the future” and states that even when ESG risk factors are sufficiently visible (but expected to crystallize outside the financial forecast horizon), they are factored into credit ratings only through qualitative considerations.7 Given the pertinence of quantitative financial forecasts for communicating credit materiality, it is essential that S&P take steps to factor long-term climate risk assessments in its quantitative financial forecasts.\\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment, to which S&P is a signatory, states that rating agencies should “include scenario analysis to address long-term [ESG] trends and risk trajectories.”8 Moritz Kraemer, who oversaw sovereign debt ratings at S&P until 2018, puts it plainly: “We have these really well-understood structural challenges coming our way over the time horizon of two, three, four decades, and that is in no way reflected in credit ratings.”9\\nTherefore we ask the Board to report on the feasibility of strengthening assessment of climate risk.\\n1\\xa0https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/210215-the-esg-pulse-2020-lookback-11835444\\n2\\xa0https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/211005-s-p-global-ratings-esg-roadmap-and-reminders-about-our-approach-12129801\\n3\\xa0https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/sp-cuts-pge-ratings-to-junk-warns-of-further-downgrade.html\\n4\\xa0https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab83a7#erlab83a7s3\\n5\\xa0https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/a-texas-power-firm-files-for-bankruptcy-after-historic-outages\\n6\\xa0https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/publication/2021/october/climate-change-adaptation-report- 2021.pdf?la=en&hash=FF4A0C618471462E10BC704D4AA58727EC8F8720\\n7\\xa0https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/211005-s-p-global-ratings-esg-roadmap-and-reminders-about-our-approach-12129801\\n8\\xa0https://www.unpri.org/credit-risk-and-ratings/esg-credit-risk-and-ratings-part-1-the-state-of-play/78.article\\n9\\xa0https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/climate-change-risk-looms-for-government-debt\\n',\n",

Utilities provide energy to some of the most GHG-intensive economic sectors. By reducing their own GHG emissions utilities can enable decarbonization across industries.\\nNatural gas, a fossil fuel, produces\\xa040 percent of the nation’s power. Burning natural gas for heat in buildings accounts for approximately\\xa011 percent of national GHG emissions.\\nCurrently, many utilities’ climate strategies rely on natural gas instead of coal due to its lower combustion emissions. Such strategies, however, often ignore Scope 3 emissions from upstream leakage, venting, and flaring in the production of natural gas and downstream emissions from customers’ combustion of natural gas.\\nSouthern Company’s net zero target includes only its Scope 1 operational emissions; it fails to include Southern’s most significant Scope 3 emissions, including upstream production emissions and downstream customer use emissions. In 2020,\\xa0Southern’s downstream customer use emissions\\xa0accounted for approximately 29 percent of its total disclosed emissions. Southern currently does not disclose upstream production emissions, but publicly available data indicates they are likely significant, adding between\\xa016-65 percent to natural gas combustion\\xa0carbon dioxide emissions. If purchased electricity, another Scope 3 category, is included, the amount of emissions not covered in Southern’s current target increases to approximately 33 percent, without accounting for upstream methane emissions.

However, TD continues to have significant exposure to fossil fuels. TD is the ninth largest funder of fossil fuels in the world, and the seventh for most funding of new fossil fuel projects since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Additionally, TD lands in the top 40 for funding coal power1. Continuing to fund fossil fuel companies and projects will ultimately prevent TD from reaching its net-zero commitment unless it makes significant changes.\\nThe IPCC’s 2021 report states that more than a 1.5C warming will have significant impacts on the frequency and severity of extreme weather events2, which lead to catastrophic economic, social, health and environmental outcomes.\\nThe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2021 report outlining the path to net-zero by 2050 stated that, in order to achieve a maximum 1.5C warming by 2050, there must be no new development of fossil fuel assets of any kind3.\\nAlthough TD has committed to not providing any project-specific funding in the Arctic, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it has not committed to ceasing corporate financing of the fossil fuel companies who could still develop in that region. Corporate financing accounts for 90% of all conventional oil and gas funding4, and eliminating direct funding to specific projects does not mitigate the risk of fossil fuel expansion.\\nCOP26 and the Glasgow Financial Alliance to Net Zero call for “smooth but rapid decarbonization”5 of the global financial sector. It is critical that TD protect shareholder value by leading the way on rapid decarbonization, through ending financing to new fossil fuel development, and maintain competitive advantage in the Canadian and global banking sectors. The physical and financial risks posed by climate change to long-term investors are systemic, portfolio-wide, unhedgeable and undiversifiable. Therefore, the actions of companies that directly,\\nor indirectly impact climate outcomes pose risks to the financial system as a whole, and to investors’ entire portfolios. In order to manage this systemic portfolio risk, investors must move beyond disclosure and company- specific climate risk management frameworks, and focus on holding accountable the relatively small number of large companies whose actions are a significant driver of climate change.\\nAdopting a short-term policy to end fossil fuel expansion will help TD meet its net-zero goals while protecting and maintaining shareholder value.\\xa0\\nhttps://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf\\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf\\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\\xa0pg 21\\nhttps://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ef8ffa01-9958-49f5-9b3b-7842e30f6177/WEI2020.pdf\\xa0pg 161\\nhttps://racetozero.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GFANZ.pdf\\xa0pg 5\\xa0\\n',\n",

       " 'Resolved:\\nTesla, Inc. (“Tesla” or “Company”) shareholders request that the company adopt a policy of immediate (within five business days) liquidation of newly-acquired cryptocurrency assets, and fully divest from existing cryptocurrency assets (including mining hardware) within one year. If the company continues to accept payments of high-impact cryptocurrencies (eg., with a per-transaction energy or e-waste footprint more than 10x of Visa’s), it should minimize their environmental impact (such as Level 2 processing).\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nA single Bitcoin transaction has a current carbon footprint of 359.04kgCO2—equivalent to 795,752 Visa transactions, 59,840 hours of watching YouTube, or driving a Model 3 approximately 3500 miles in California. The majority of this electricity comes from coal, keeping stranded assets operating 24/7. It likewise subsidizes stranded oil and gas resources, allowing them to offset increasing pollution taxes. This is a massive step backwards for Tesla’s mission of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The minority of Bitcoin’s massive energy demands generated from renewables are creating their own problems. For example, Bitcoin’s rush on Iceland’s renewable power has consumed its available capacity in many regions and is leading to new hydropower projects, causing public backlash—with Tesla’s cryptocurrency advocacy specifically associated as a cause. If one wants to visually see the impact of even “renewable Bitcoin mining”, they need only to do an image search for “Hvalárvirkjun” to see the sort of things being sacrificed. Bitcoin ASICs become obsolete after ~1.5 years. A single transaction creates an E-waste volume greater than 20,000 Visa transactions. The network as a whole creates an E-waste volume similar to that of a small country, despite processing only ~7 transactions per second. Tesla is not simply a participant in cryptocurrency markets, but a driver. Bitcoin prices surged specifically because of Tesla’s involvement (alongside other companies’ actions triggered in response to Tesla’s). Bitcoin transaction fees—the primary driver of adding new hardware (and thus energy consumption and E-waste) to the network—spiked from $11.49 to $29.73 within days of Tesla’s announcement, and in the subsequent months averaged approximately $20 per transaction. Tesla’s cryptocurrency investments also create extreme volatility risks to its balance sheet. BTC commonly fluctuates by ~20% in a normal month. In March 2020, it lost 2/5ths of its value in one day. For the year starting in mid-December 2017 it lost 4/5ths of its value. By contrast, since 2012 the USD inflation rate has not exceeded 3%; the highest rate in the past 25 years is under 6%; and the highest rate ever was under 20%. Each car sold for non-redeemed cryptocurrency puts at risk the profits on five cars sold for cash. Investors were diluted to gain the “excess cash” for cryptocurrency purchases, which appeared on Tesla’s balance sheets from a $5B December share offering. It is additionally debatable what can be considered “excess” when Tesla could be using money to acquire critical-path suppliers or key mineral resources, expanding service, or even merely completing Giga Nevada’s much-postponed solar roof.\\n',\n",

Flexible plastic, used widely by Tyson, represents 59% of all plastic production but accounts for 80% of plastic leakage to oceans.\\xa0Microplastics can now be found in our food and water, with one study finding humans may consume a credit card’s worth of plastic every week.\\xa0\\nA Pew Charitable Trust study found that existing industry and government commitments will only reduce marine plastic pollution 7% by 2040.

In another, two-thirds of Millennial and Gen Z respondents reported taking steps to reduce their single-use plastic usage, and both generations named climate change and the environment as their top societal concerns.\\nTyson’s lagging plastic policies also may leave it vulnerable to a changing regulatory landscape. This past summer, Maine and Oregon adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for post-consumer packaging waste management, and nine other states considered similar legislation.

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent “Emissions Gap Report” from the United Nations Environment Programme (October 26, 2021), critical gaps remain between the commitments of national governments and the actions necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policymakers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels present regulatory, reputational, and legal risks to companies. Such policy engagement also presents systemic risks to economies and markets, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, undermine economic stability, and introduce into investment portfolios uncertainty and volatility. We believe Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps mitigate these risks and contributes positively to the long-term value of companies.\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis. When a company presents itself as a proponent of climate action but funds organizations that work against policy solutions, it exposes itself to potential reputational damage, especially in this age of social media.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C—as an imperative. We remain convinced that unabated climate change characterized by “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater will have unacceptable and far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal implications.\\nUnion Pacific presently provides insufficient information to demonstrate how our company works to ensure its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals, and what management and the board do to address misalignments. While the company publicly discloses a list of its trade association memberships, it does not discuss any direct engagement with them on climate change, their climate policy positions, its role within each association, nor does the company disclose any actions taken in the event of misalignments on climate policy.

This does not include state lobbying, where United also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, United spent $1,014,588 on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2020. United’s lobbying attracts media attention, including baggage fees1 and CEO Kirby directly lobbying Congress over airline bailouts.2\\nUnited fails to disclose its memberships in or payments to trade associations and social welfare organizations or the amounts used for lobbying, including grassroots. Companies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and often undisclosed grassroots activity, and these groups may be spending “at least double what’s publicly reported.”3 United serves on the boards of Airlines for America, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Chamber of Commerce and belongs to the Business Roundtable, which altogether spent $207,814,400 on federal lobbying for 2019 and 2020.\\xa0\\nWe are concerned that United’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, United showed real leadership as the first US airline to publicly commit to a carbon emissions reduction target, yet IATA has lobbied to weaken carbon reduction regulations for international aviation.4 And United has spoken out against state voter restrictions, yet the Chamber lobbied against the For the People Act.5 According to the 2021 Harris Corporate Reputation Survey, United ranked 87th of the 100 most visible US companies.6 We believe\\xa0reputational damage stemming from these misalignments could harm stockholder value, and thus urge United to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Description:\\nGreen Century, Trillium, and Zevin partnered as co-lead filers on this resolution.\\n\\nWhereas:\\nIn 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evaluated the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and advised that net carbon emissions must fall 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and prevent the worst consequences of climate change. However, in 2020, the UN reported the world is “way off-track” from achieving these goals.\\xa0\\nExceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius presents risks to the global economy and investors: up to 10% of total global economic value is projected to be lost by 2050 under current emissions trajectories.\\xa0A warming climate is associated with supply chain disruptions, reduced resource availability, lost production, political instability, reduced worker efficiency, and adverse health impacts that disproportionally affect low-income communities and communities of color. Additionally, particulate matter emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles pollute communities of color at significantly higher rates than white communities.\\xa0\\nWhile UPS has announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations by 2050 and a 50% reduction in emissions per small package delivered by 2035, shareholders do not know if UPS plans on achieving net zero through actual emissions reductions or through the purchase of carbon offsets. In order to assure shareholders that its goals align with the Paris Agreement, UPS should set a science-based target verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which requires annual disclosure of emissions.\\xa0\\nWhereas peers like FedEx and Amazon have set goals for procurement of electric vehicles, UPS’ goals for its ground fleet rely on alternative fuel, which unnecessarily prolongs potential emissions and bolsters fossil fuel infrastructure. UPS’ current emissions reduction goals do not include Scope 3 emissions, which, according to UPS’ 2020 TCFD report, constitute 57% of its total.\\xa0\\nGiven the impact of climate change on the economy, the environment, and human systems, and UPS’s contribution to it, proponents believe the UPS board and management have a responsibility to its investors and stakeholders to adopt GHG goals aligned with a 1.5 degree scenario and to outline a clear plan that demonstrates accountability. Independently verified, science-based goals covering Scopes 1-3 would provide shareholders with objective assurance that UPS is doing its part to reduce emissions in a comprehensive and timely manner.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that UPS adopt independently verified short, medium, and long-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, inclusive of emissions from its full value chain, in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner and to attain appropriate emissions reductions prior to 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn assessing targets, we recommend, at management’s discretion:\\nConsideration of approaches used by advisory groups such as the Science Based Targets initiative;\\nDisclosing these targets to investors at least 180 days prior to the next annual meeting.\\n',\n",

Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policymakers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational, and legal risks to companies and investors and to the entire economy. Delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increases the physical risks of climate change, poses a systemic risk to economic stability, and introduces uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios; Paris-aligned climate lobbying by companies and trade associations help to mitigate these risks.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C—as an imperative. Of particular concern are trade associations that speak for business but, unfortunately, often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\nIn 2020 and 2021, seven companies received shareholder resolutions urging their boards to publish evaluations of their climate lobbying efforts ; six of those resolutions received a majority vote, demonstrating a tremendous show of investor interest in this issue. Numerous companies in both the U.S. and Europe have produced or agreed to issue reports evaluating their lobbying programs in the past two years.\\nWe commend UPS for recently setting a Paris-aligned Net Zero emissions goal and a concrete plan to implement it. We believe a company should carefully evaluate whether its public policy advocacy advances or undercuts the goals of the Paris Agreement.\\nUPS presently provides insufficient information to help investors understand if or how UPS works to ensure that its lobbying activities, directly, in the company’s name, and indirectly, through membership organizations and trade associations, align with the Paris Agreement’s goals, and what management and the board do to address any misalignments found.\\nUPS is an active member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which frequently takes negative positions on climate change. UPS does not disclose what actions they take when an organization like ALEC contradicts UPS’s own climate positions. Similarly, UPS does not disclose how they engage major trade associations, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, on climate lobbying activities.\\n',\n",

The Company has established the following specific goals:\\n· By 2025\\n25 percent renewable electricity for facilities\\n40 percent alternative fuel purchases as a percent of total ground fuel\\n· By 2035\\n30 percent sustainable aviation fuel\\n100 percent renewable electricity for facilities\\n50 percent reduction in carbon dioxide per package delivered for global small packages.1\\nThese goals do not appear consistent with the consensus on measures necessary to keep global warming below disastrous levels. More consistent measures could include:\\nMeeting a 1.5-degree Celsius Science-Based Target standard\\nAchieving a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030\\nCommitting to purchasing only electric light-duty vehicles by 2025\\nThe gap between the Company’s declared goals and “Paris alignment” may be due to the Company’s decision only to address the risk of climate change to the enterprise, rather than addressing the risks the Company poses to the environment: while the Company identifies climate change as having “inherently high risk to the organization,”2 the public documents that discuss the Company’s climate stance disclose no consideration of climate change’s broad environmental stakes such as:\\nHalving GDP growth by the end of the century3\\nHaving “broad implications for macroeconomic performance, including inflation, interest rates, balance of payments, productivity, wealth, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth”4\\nShrinking the world economy by 3 percent by 2050.5\\nLowered GDP will directly reduce returns to diversified investors,6 and a warming planet may create serious disruption costs that further threaten financial markets.7 By adopting a slower pace of mitigation, the Company is able to increase its margins and financial performance. But improved Company financial performance that comes at the expense of the environment and the economy is a bad trade for most Company shareholders, who are diversified and rely on broad economic growth to achieve their financial objectives.\\nThis proposal asks for a report that analyzes the climate trade-offs the Company makes between financial return and the global economy, and how those trade-offs affect diversified shareholders. Such a report would not require precision: identifying areas where the Company is choosing not to accelerate decarbonization and analyzing how such choices manifest as costs or risks to diversified portfolios would help determine whether and when the Company should prioritize Paris alignment over financial returns.\\n[1]https://investors.ups.com/_assets/ups/files/pages/ups/db/1149/description/UPS+ESG+Strategy+June+2021.pdf\\n[2]https://about.ups.com/content/dam/upsstories/assets/reporting/sustainability-2021/2020_UPS_TCFD_Report_081921.pdf\\n[3]https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/9-9-20%20Report%20of%20the%20Subcommittee%20on%20Climate-Related%20Market%20Risk%20-%20Managing%20Climate%20Risk%20in%20the%20U.S.%20Financial%20System%20for%20posting.pdf\\n',\n",

Further, US Foods has not yet measured or disclosed its comprehensive Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3, or value chain, emissions are likely to be US Foods’ greatest emissions source. For context, Sysco, a US Foods competitor, discloses that Scope 3 emissions make up 98% of its total emissions. Deforestation is a major source of Scope 3 emissions for food companies, and US Foods also lacks a comprehensive no-deforestation policy.\\nCompeting foodservice distribution companies, including Sysco and UNFI, are setting reduction targets for their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and seeking validation of these targets through the Science Based Targets initiative.

       " 'Resolved:\\nThat shareholders of Wells Fargo & Company (“WFC”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee an independent racial equity audit analyzing WFC’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information, should be publicly disclosed on WFC’s website.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nHigh-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement, together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media, the public and policy makers on systemic racism, racialized violence and inequities in employment, health care, and the criminal justice system.\\xa0\\nIn June 2020, WFC CEO Charles Scharf urged that “the inequality and discrimination that has been so clearly exposed . . . must not continue,” and WFC announced initiatives to improve workforce diversity and inclusion and invest in\\xa0black-owned businesses.1 Those actions followed some missteps: Scharf\\'s statement that he appointed white men to top jobs after arriving at WFC because of “a very limited pool of Black talent,” demoralizing black employees, and the loss of black\\xa0female top managers.2\\nWFC’s problems predate Scharf’s 2019 arrival. WFC has settled employment discrimination claims on several recent occasions, including incidents of race discrimination in 2014 uncovered through a Labor Department audit. In 2019, WFC settled a lawsuit by the City of Philadelphia alleging that WFC targeted nonwhite\\xa0neighborhoods for high-fee and high-interest rate loans.3 In 2012, the same practices led to a $184 million Department of Justice settlement. A 2021 investigation found racial disparities in WFC’s lending under the Paycheck Protection Program in Los Angeles: businesses in majority-white neighborhoods were more than twice as likely to receive funding as businesses in\\xa0majority-nonwhite neighborhoods.4\\nWFC’s activities with potential adverse impacts are not limited to the employment and lending contexts. WFC has supported numerous police foundations, which bypass normal procurement processes to buy equipment for police departments, including surveillance technology that has been used to target communities of color and nonviolent protestors. In the 2020 election cycle, WFC gave $135,000 to members of Congress who objected to certifying the election\\xa0results,5 an action some viewed as \"a direct attack on the voting rights of people of color.\"6 Although WFC paused PAC contributions after the insurrection, it resumed them following a review of its criteria. WFC is a member of the American Bankers\\xa0Association, which continues to donate to objecting members.7\\nA racial equity audit would help WFC identify, prioritize, remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. We urge WFC to assess its behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to, and could help dismantle, systemic racism.\\xa0\\n1 See\\xa0https://stories.wf.com/wells-fargo-ceo-a-watershed-moment/\\xa0\\n2\\xa0https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-ceo-finds-himself-on-defense-after-a-tough-first-year-116021\\n49402?mod=hp_lead_pos5 3\\nhttps://whyy.org/articles/wells-fargo-will-pay-philadelphia-10m-to-settle-citys-discriminatory-lending-lawsuit/\\n\\ufeff4\\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-01/ppp-loans-coronavirus-pandemic-businesses-trump\\n5\\xa0https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2021/01/business/corporate-pac-suspensions/\\n6 See\\xa0https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/us/politics/lankford-apology-election-biden.html;\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/business-leaders-call-for-action-on-trump-after-mob-siege-at-capitol-11609976655\\nhttps://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/corporations-have-given-10-million-to-the-sedition-caucus/\\n',\n",

The UNEP FI, which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible net zero commitments of financial institutions, including: “A financial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should begin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of IPCC 1.5°C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible….All no/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in fossil fuels, signaling that investment in new fossil fuel development is not aligned with 1.5°C.”4 Another of the world’s most credible sources, the IEA, in its NZE scenario, states that “no fossil fuel exploration is required and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development.”5 WFC has restricted financing for new coal operations and Arctic drilling, but has no policy to halt financing any new oil and gas exploration and development. The Banking on Climate Chaos report shows WFC as the fourth highest financier of companies expanding fossil fuels.6\\nWFC faces two associated problems: first, its prominence in asserting climate leadership flies in the face of its actions, creating reputational risk from accusations of greenwashing; second, underwriting or lending to projects which are unneeded under the UNEP FI recommendations or IEA NZE scenario potentially loads stranded assets onto its balance sheet or those of its customers. In this regard, investors need to know that WFC’s lending and underwriting policies are consistent with its own net zero commitment.\\n1https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/goals-performance-data.pdf, at 29.\\n2\\xa0https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/climate-change-informationrequest.pdf, at 22.\\n3\\xa0https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-NZBA-Commitment-Statement.pdf\\n4\\xa0https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-UNEP-FI.-Recommendations-for-Credible-NetZero-Commitments.pdf, at 15.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Internationally-recognized standards for Indigenous Peoples’ rights are the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Labour Organization Convention 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. 1 Violation of the rights of Indigenous Peoples presents risks for Wells Fargo that can adversely affect shareholder value, including reputational damage, project delays and disruptions, litigation, and criminal charges.2 Wells Fargo adopted the Equator Principles (EPs) in 2005, committing to only finance projects by borrowers who exhibit social and environmental responsibility.3 The company faces reputational risk if it finances projects that conflict with its own commitments. Despite EP enhancements in 2019 after several members, including Wells Fargo, failed to respect Indigenous Rights by financing the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL), Wells Fargo is providing $3.86 billion in financing for the Enbridge Line 3 tar sands pipeline expansion “Line 3”.4\\nSimilar to DAPL, Line 3 poses significant risks to the land, water, and cultural rights of several Anishinaabe tribes. The expansion violates numerous rights of Indigenous Peoples as protected by international law, including the rights to free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC); health; culture; religion; security; and assembly.5 In particular, Line 3 threatens access to and health of manoomin, or wild rice, which is central to the survival of Anishinaabe culture.6 The pipeline, with estimated emissions equivalent to 50 coal plants, significantly contributes to climate change, disparately affecting Tribes.7 Enbridge and its partners have consistently failed to meet the international standard of FPIC as well as domestic standards of consultation with the Anishinaabe. 8\\nLine 3 presents similar material risks as DAPL, which was estimated to incur over $7.5 billion in costs due to material social risks.9 Line 3 has a history of ruptures and spills, most recently spilling approximately 10,000 gallons of drilling fluid between July and August 2021.10 The project has\\xa0been the subject of numerous lawsuits, including challenges to the Clean Water Act permit and tribal court litigation on the natural rights of manoomin. 11\\nFurthermore, militarized response to protests and alleged violation of constitutional rights exposes Wells Fargo to reputational and litigation risk.12 Enbridge has reimbursed U.S. law enforcement over $2 million for policing protests against the construction of Line 3.13 Tactics included rubber bullets, pepper spray, solitary confinement in jail, denial of medications, and the bringing of excessive or inappropriate charges.14 There have been over 900 arrests, citations, and charges levied against Water Protectors, as well as harassment, surveillance,15 instances of sex trafficking, and violence against women.16\\xa0\\xa0\\n1\\xa0https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenouspeoples.html ; https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314\\n2\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attachedfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf\\n3\\xa0https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/our-approach.pdf\\n4\\xa0https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Briefing_Line3_KXL.pdf\\n5\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attached-files/cerd_request_line_3_pipeline.pdf\\n6\\xa0https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a3c10abebafb5c4b3293ac/t/5bea2acc89858370442dec08/1542073038236/fa%20ctsheet+TREATY+RIGHTS.pdf\\n7\\xa0https://mn350.org/giant-step-backward/\\n8\\xa0https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CERD_ALE_USA_9448_E.pdf\\n9\\xa0https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attachedfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf\\n10\\xa0https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/08/16/enbridge-line-3-drilling-fluid-spills-what-we-know-so-far/\\n11\\xa0https://www.hcn.org/articles/latest-justice-wild-rice-sues-to-stop-oilpipeline#:~:text=It%20declared%20that%20within%20White,%2C%20recovery%2C%20and%20preservation.%E2%80%9D\\n12\\xa0https://www.protestlaw.org/line3\\xa0;\\xa0https://www.promisehumanrights.blog/blog/2021/10/oil-flows-aslawsuits-continue-over-enbridges-line-3-pipeline\\n13\\xa0https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/05/line-3-pipeline-enbridge-paid-police-arrest-protesters\\n14\\xa0https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/protesters-line-3-minnesota-oil-gas-pipeline\\xa0;\\xa0https://www.vogue.com/article/letter-from-a-jailed-line-3-water-protector\\n15\\xa0https://theintercept.com/2021/08/07/minnesota-pipeline-line-3-public-records/\\n16\\xa0https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/03/08/shelter-reports-assaults-harassment-linked-to-line-3-pipelineworkers/\\xa0;\\xa0https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gkpw/four-enbridge-pipeline-workers-linked-to-sex-traffickingminnesota\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors provide a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary and confidential information, outlining how effective Wells Fargo’s policies, practices, and performance indicators are in respecting internationally recognized human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples’ rights in its existing and proposed general corporate and project financing.\\n',\n",

Companies and shareholders must have a common understanding of what net zero means, and accepted methods of achieving it. Many companies are relying on offsets to achieve long-term net zero targets, rather than decarbonization of their own enterprise and supply chain emissions.\\nShareholders expect companies’ use of offsets to align with expert guidance including the\\xa0Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\\xa0and/or the\\xa0CA100+ Benchmark. Both emphasize that carbon credits should not be counted toward progress in near-term emissions reductions, and in the long term, carbon offsets should be used only for neutralizing residual emissions where viable decarbonization technologies do not yet exist. Carbon credits can optimally be used to compensate for ongoing emissions while companies reduce emissions over time.\\nInvestors require disclosures on how carbon credits are applied in order to assess whether a company’s emissions reduction strategy is science-based and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.\\nOur Company has committed to reduce operational (Scopes 1-2) emissions 50 percent by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality” by 2025. Our Company states that it will “offset any GHG we don’t eliminate, making our impact neutral.” This implies that our company does not intend to reduce its full Scopes 1-2 emissions or its Scope 3 emissions, relying instead on carbon credits generated outside of the company to attain “carbon neutrality.” Investors seek greater clarity from Williams-Sonoma on its use of carbon credits.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Williams-Sonoma issue a report within a year, at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information, disclosing additional information on its use of carbon credits, including type of credits, verification, timing, and whether carbon credits are intended to substitute for emissions reductions beyond current goals.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponents suggest, at Board and Company discretion, the report describe:\\nA description of credits purchased;\\nThe number of credits purchased and retired each year;\\nIf and how credits are accounted for in emissions data;\\nThe amount of carbon credits expected to be used to achieve net zero emissions, including for what scopes of emissions and approximate time frames for use;\\nThe organization from which offsets and credits are or will be verified;\\nThe Company’s standards or policies for purchasing carbon offsets.\\n\\n',\n",

Companies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and often undisclosed grassroots activity, and these groups may\\xa0be spending “at least double what’s publicly reported.”[2]\\xa0XPO belongs to the Business Roundtable (BRT) and Transportation Intermediaries Association, which together spent $37,930,000 on federal lobbying for 2019 and 2020, and to the Road Haulage Association (RHA) in the United Kingdom. And XPO does not disclose its contributions to groups which write and endorse model legislation, like the American Legislative Exchange Council, which supports ending government regulation over private contracting.[3].\\nWe believe XPO’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, XPO lists safety for its employees and operations as its first value, yet has been accused of a business model “based on exploitation, illegal underpayments, and a callous approach to safety” for workers.[4]\\xa0And, XPO is committed to environmental sustainability, yet the RHA has reportedly lobbied to undermine clean air goals in the UK.[5]\\nWe urge XPO to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n[1]\\xa0https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/06/usps-dejoy-xpo-logistics/.\\n[2]\\xa0https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/.\\n[3]\\xa0https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2020/12/03/alec-holds-virtual-states-and-national-policy-summit/.\\n[4]\\xa0https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/10/xpo-logistics-worker-report-delivering-injustice.\\n[5]\\xa0https://www.desmog.co.uk/2020/10/05/revealed-lobby-groups-backed-big-brands-fighting-against-air-\\n\",\n",

       " 'The ocean plastics crisis continues unabated, fatally impacting more than 800 marine species, and causing up to $2.5 trillion in damage annually to marine ecosystems. Toxins adhere to plastics consumed by marine species, which potentially transfer to human diets. There could be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050.\\xa0\\nRecently, Pew Charitable Trusts released a groundbreaking study, Breaking the Plastic Wave, which concluded that if all current industry and government commitments were met, ocean plastic deposition would be reduced by only 7%.\\xa0Without immediate and sustained new commitments throughout the plastics value chain, annual flow of plastic into oceans could nearly triple by 2040.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe report finds that improved recycling will be insufficient to stem the plastic tide, and must be coupled with upstream activities like reduction in demand, materials redesign, and substitution. “Brand owners, fast-moving consumer goods companies and retailers should lead the transition by committing to reduce at least one-third of plastic demand through elimination, reuse, and new delivery models,” the report states, adding that reducing plastic production is the most attractive solution from environmental, economic, and social perspectives.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmazon does not disclose how much plastic packaging it uses but is believed to be one of the largest corporate users of flexible plastic packaging, which cannot be recycled. A recent report estimated that Amazon generated 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year and that up to 22 million pounds of its plastic packaging waste entered the world’s marine ecosystems. Flexible packaging represents 59% of all plastic production but an outsized 80% of plastic leaking into oceans. Amazon has no goal to make all of its packaging recyclable.\\xa0\\nUnilever has taken the most significant corporate action to date, agreeing to cut plastic packaging use by 100,000 tons by 2025. PepsiCo has committed to substitute recycled content for 35% of virgin plastic in its beverage division.

However, our Company has not explicitly linked sustainability goals with senior executive incentives.

Another prominent example is Royal Dutch Shell, which announced in December 2018 its plans to tie a portion of executive pay to concrete targets linked to the company’s net carbon footprint.\\nThe increasing incorporation of sustainability metrics into executive pay evaluative criteria stems from the growing recognition that sustainability strategies can drive growth, as well as enhance profitability and shareholder value.\\nThe 2016 Glass Lewis report\\xa0In-Depth: Linking Compensation to Sustainability\\xa0found a “mounting body of research showing that firms that operate in a more responsible manner may perform better financially....

Linking sustainability metrics to executive compensation could reduce risks related to sustainability underperformance, incentivize employees to meet sustainability goals and achieve resultant benefits, and increase accountability.

       " 'Our company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in August 2019, signed a “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” committing our company to all stakeholders, supporting “ ... the communities in which we work ... respect[ing] the people in our communities and protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainability practices across our businesses;” and Whereas, inconsistent with our bank’s “embrace of sustainability,” our bank from 2016 through 2019 loaned over $156 billion in fossil fuel financing according to Banking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report 2020, helping to drive multigenerational climate change. The commitment of bank policy to all stakeholders, and to sustainability such as addressing climate impacts, raises potential conflicts for board members bound by fiduciary duties reflected in our company’s Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, Committee Charters, and Delaware law. Fortunately, the State of Delaware in 2013 enacted a law to permit Delaware corporations to amend their Certificates of Incorporation to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), to commit to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner; and Whereas, pursuant to Delaware law, a “public benefit” is to encourage corporations to operate in such a manner that is in the best interests of those materially affected by its conduct, which includes other stakeholders in addition to shareholders; and Whereas, recently Delaware adopted new amendments to the public benefit law that made the adoption of the new structure more attractive and accessible. [https: //www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-amendments-to-delaware-general-76927/]. The amended law reduces certain board member fiduciary liabilities for breaches of stakeholder interests, and reduces the required shareholder approval of the conversion to a majority vote; and Whereas, in the opinion of the proponent, this law seems to be consistent with our company’s commitment to the Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation, providing the opportunity for the board to legally articulate the purpose of our corporation in a manner that would reconcile accountability to stakeholders, therefore, be it\\n\\nResolved:\\nThat shareholders request the Board to approve an amendment to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to become a Public Benefit Corporation pursuant to Delaware law and to submit the proposed amendment to the shareholders for approval. Such a change would enable the company to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that balances the stockholders’ pecuniary interests, and the best interests of those stakeholders affected by the corporation’s conduct.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nThe proponent recommends that the Board, in its discretion, consider stating a public purpose in the amended certificate that reflects a forward looking vision regarding the company’s impacts on stakeholders.

Protests surrounding drilling in the Arctic are among the high-profile concerns.\\nThrough 2019 and 2020, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citibank, and Wells Fargo & Co. made commitments amounting to a rejection of much funding of oil and gas development in the Arctic. This leaves Bank of America as the last large U.S. bank not to do so.\\nAccording to a poll conducted in 2019 by Yale and George Mason University, 67% of voters oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\nIn September 2019, the House of Representatives voted 225-193 to reinstate a ban on drilling the refuge.\\nIn February 2020, 16 U.S. Senators and 33 members of the U.S. House of Representatives sent letters to Bank of America and other major banks urging the companies to not finance drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\nIn July 2020 a group of faith leaders including the North Carolina Council of Churches, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Office of Public Witness, and the Fourth Episcopal District African Methodist Episcopal Church wrote to Bank of America “in solidarity with the Gwich’in people in Alaska… to urge [the company] to oppose oil and gas exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.”\\nIn August 2020, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination announced it is conducting an investigation into the U.S. government’s respect for Free Prior and Informed Consent, the adequacy of protection of sacred sights, and the adequacy of protections against violence against indigenous women related to the leasing of land for oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\nBeyond the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, drilling anywhere in the Arctic threatens Indigenous rights and impacts a fragile ecosystem.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors issue a report (at reasonable expense, within a reasonable time, and omitting confidential or propriety information) describing if and how Bank of America plans to respond to rising reputational risks for the company related to involvement in Arctic oil and gas exploration and production.\\n',\n",

(the “Company”) and so investors can understand and manage risk more effectively, shareowners request that the board of the Company publish an annual assessment addressing how the Company manages physical and transitional climate-related risks and opportunities, commencing prior to its 2022 annual shareholders’ meeting. At the board’s discretion, shareholders recommend that the report also includes:\\xa0\\nSummaries of risks and opportunities for each of the Company’s subsidiaries and investee organizations that the board believes could be materially impacted by, or significantly contributing to, climate change;\\nAn explanation of how the board oversees and manages climate-related risks and opportunities; and,\\nAn examination of the feasibility of the Company establishing science-based, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, consistent with limiting climate change to well-below 2C.\\nThe disclosure ought to include the details of any scenarios used, along with any material assumptions for determining physical and transitional risks for the Company’s subsidiaries and investee organizations which are deemed by the Company to be materially impacted by climate change and the energy transition. The assessment may be a stand-alone report or incorporated into existing reporting, and may cover topics such as governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics & targets. The assessment should be prepared at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nClimate change and the energy transition to a low-carbon economy pose a systemic risk to the economy. Many risks are already taking effect, impacting the value of companies across multiple sectors. All companies should recognize and appraise physical and transitional climate risks. These risks and the board’s approach to their management, including any plans to achieve net-zero emissions, should be disclosed to enable these to be appraised by investors. We consider the Company’s current level of disclosure to be insufficient for investors to fully appraise its material climate-related risks and opportunities.\\xa0\\nThe Company’s disclosures show that it is concerned about the long-term viability of the companies it owns and in which it invests. The disclosure of climate-related information complements this long-term approach. We recommend that the board consider aligning the disclosure of the Company’s climate-related risks and opportunities with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Over 1,440 companies, including United States based industrial companies, support the TCFD recommendations, with 59 of the Climate Action 100+ companies already reporting in line with this framework.\\nMany corporations have joined the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to set verifiable science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets consistent with limiting global emissions to well below 2C. For example, CSX, a competitor to the Company’s BNSF railroad subsidiary, and National Grid, an electric utility company, are two of over 450 companies whose greenhouse gas targets have been verified and approved by the SBTi. Union Pacific, another competitor of BNSF, has committed to setting science-based targets, joining over 500 companies that have made such commitments to the SBTi.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Climate change is an existential threat. Without a robust effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to face significant systemic risks such as an increase in severe weather systems, infrastructure damage, reduced resource availability, lost productivity, and supply chain disruptions. Further, people with underlying health conditions, like the patients BioMarin Pharmaceutical (“BioMarin”) is dedicated to treating, may suffer disproportionately from climate change-induced weather such as increased incidents of heat waves.\\xa0\\nAs governments acknowledge the potential costs of a changing climate, they are moving to limit greenhouse gas emissions through such mechanisms as carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, and state or national emissions limits. This creates risk for the pharmaceutical industry. According to an analysis by McMaster University, the global pharmaceutical industry released more carbon emissions than the global automotive industry by a staggering 55% in 2015. Consequently, many pharmaceutical companies, identifying their exposure to this regulatory risk, have taken steps to adopt greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.\\nCompanies that start addressing regulatory risk now, may be better positioned to meet future regulations at a lower capital investment. In California, where BioMarin’s headquarters and a major manufacturing facility are located, an executive order was signed in 2018 committing California to carbon neutrality by 2045. Similarly, a law was passed during the same year committing California to source 100% renewable energy, also by 2045.\\xa0\\nWhile BioMarin has taken steps to mitigate its risk – through construction of solar panels and charging stations and purchase of renewable energy – investors lack insight into Company’s overarching reduction goals. In addition to setting a greenhouse gas reduction target, we believe it is best practice to adopt public-facing renewable energy procurement and energy efficiency improvement targets. Adoption of such targets makes good business sense.\\xa0They indicate to investors that BioMarin has an overall plan to manage climate risk, and increased renewable energy usage and improved energy-efficiency can also reduce operating costs and hedge against a future rise in fossil fuel prices.\\nGiven the impact of climate change on the economy, the environment, and vulnerable human populations, proponents believe BioMarin has a clear responsibility to its investors to account for whether, and how, it plans to reduce its ongoing climate impacts.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that BioMarin issue a public report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing if, and how, it plans to reduce its total contribution to climate change and set public-facing greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy, and energy efficiency targets.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn the report shareholders seek information, among other issues at board and management discretion, on the relative benefits and drawbacks of integrating the following actions:\\nQuantifying BioMarin’s greenhouse gas emissions for direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions,\\nAdopting short- and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement,\\nDeveloping a public-facing plan for achieving its GHG targets,\\nAdopting public-facing renewable energy and energy efficiency targets.\\n',\n",

Moreover, proxy voting practices that are out of step with climate change risks seem to ignore the amplification effects of a vote supporting climate change disclosure in its invested companies. Shareholder affirmative votes on climate change proposals identify the need for change and for accountability at particular companies and in particular sectors.\\nBlackRock’s stated views on climate risk are at odds with much of its proxy voting practices and the company would better serve all its stakeholders by creating a more holistic voting response. In addition, it is out of step with its own philosophy, as for BlackRock lags the investment industry on supporting climate change proposals.\\nWe believe it is BlackRock’s fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change quantitatively impacts portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate may impact shareholder value, and vote accordingly.

CIBC is committed to increasing sustainable finance, but a comprehensive climate change plan would also include a commitment to reduce financed emissions. This would provide investors with relevant information to assess the bank’s ability to manage climate related risks and opportunities.\\nAlthough there are uncertainties about how businesses can decarbonize, many companies, including financial institutions such as TD, HSBC and Morgan Stanley, have adopted net zero by 2050 targets. Over 30 institutional investors, including CDPQ and Calpers have committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance).

       " \"Chevron sees global Liquid Natural Gas demand rising by 130% to 2035, and is considering new investments lasting beyond mid century. But Liquid Natural Gas faces displacement risk from falling cost renewable energy, financial risk from broadening carbon pricing and technology risk from (among others) hydrogen. As an Oil and Gas Climate Alliance member publicly aligned with the Paris Climate Accord, Chevron is committed to accelerating industry's response to climate change, including reaching net zero emissions after 2050. But -- to cite one example -- Chevron's US$25 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project in Australia -- one of the world's largest energy projects - is expected by Chevron to export fossil fuel until at least 2056, six years beyond 2050. Meanwhile, Chevron is still considering new LNG investments with operating life spans potentially stretching to 2100. Liquid Natural Gas' Scope Three (or life cycle) carbon emissions amount to roughly .66 tonnes of carbon per megawatt-hour equivalent of electricity generated, according to the US Department of Energy. While that is roughly one-fifth lower than coal's Scope Three emissions of .8 tonnes per megawatt-hour equivalent, it is 16 times higher than solar's Scope Three emissions of .04 tonnes per megawatt-hour and 66 times higher than wind's Scope Three emissions of .01 tonnes per megawatt-hour, according to the US Energy Department, the Union of Concerned Scientists and others. Those are large differences. Pricing Chevron's Scope One (or internal) emissions at the US Social Cost of Carbon yields a number equal to a fifth of Chevron's net income, representing an uncounted negative externality that flatters Chevron's true financial performance. Credible researchers (Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Lazard, the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Department, among others) now conclude wind and solar will out-compete Liquid Natural Gas by the mid-2030s in Scope Three carbon adjusted terms. This matters because the International Monetary Fund now admonishes investors to take increasing heed of climate change in investment decisions. Making things harder here is Chevron's refusal to set internal Scope Three targets, instead preferring unspecified internal carbon emission reduction incentives. These look inadequate to meet post-2050 net zero targets, suggesting Chevron views such targets as either satisfiable though unspecified future offsets or likely to prove retroactively non-binding.\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nInvestors seek a report on the Scope Three emissions from Chevron’s Liquid Natural Gas operations and how the company plans to\\noffset, pay carbon taxes on or eliminate via technology these emissions to meet post-2050 Paris Accord carbon emission reduction goals to which Chevron is publicly committed and fellow oil major British Petroleum has pledged to meet.\\n\",\n",

The widely recognized Paris Climate Agreement established the imperative to limit global temperature increases well below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Alarmingly, the most recent science shows achieving this goal is now “extremely unlikely.”[1]\\xa0Thus, more urgent and ambitious action is needed from all sectors.\\nWhile Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) has adopted some initiatives to begin to address its climate impact, including installing renewable energy at some facilities, measuring its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, and working to reduce energy use, its measured carbon footprint continues to grow, up 6.5% in 2018 alone. Significantly, Costco has not measured the carbon footprint of its supply chains – called scope 3 emissions – which are often many times larger than a company’s direct footprint. Costco says its supply chain emissions are “relevant,” but it has not disclosed plans to measure or reduce them.\\nAgricultural supply chains are particularly susceptible to climate change. The 2018 National Climate Assessment found “climate change presents numerous challenges to sustaining and enhancing crop productivity, livestock health, and the economic vitality of rural communities,” and rising temperatures are “the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of U.S. agriculture.” Costco is heavily reliant on agriculture as it derived over 50% of its FY19 revenue from its “Food and Sundries” and “Fresh Foods” merchandise categories. In addition, Costco’s Kirkland Signature brand accounts for roughly 25% of Costco’s total sales.[2]\\xa0Thus, the impacts of climate change on, and the emissions generated from, Costco’s agricultural supply chains are major issues for the Company.\\nSeveral retailers and food-based businesses including Walmart, BestBuy, Target, McDonald’s, PepsiCo, Nestle, Mars, Kellogg, and Danone are not only measuring their full value chain emissions (scopes 1, 2, and 3) but are also pursuing long-term, science-based emissions reductions consistent with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\\nEach company is implementing different strategies to achieve this common goal. Examples include working with farmers on low-carbon agricultural techniques, focusing resiliency efforts on at-risk producers, and collaborating with other companies to scale efforts.\\nGiven the clear need for more urgent and ambitious action on climate change, proponents believe committing to measure and reduce Costco’s full value chain emissions footprint is a vital course of action that will help reduce risks associated with climate change, including production and supply disruptions, and help prepare the Company for future carbon-related regulations.\\n[1]\\xa0https://www.wcrp-climate.org/news/science-highlights/1604-climate-sensitivity-2020\\n[2]\\xa0https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-kirkland-brand-drives-growth-2019-3\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request Costco issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing if, and how, it plans to measure and reduce its total contribution to climate change, including emissions from its supply chains, and align its operations with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature increases well below 2 degrees Celsius.\\n',\n",

       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) ask the Board of Directors to adopt a policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require the Chair of the Board to be an independent member of the Board. This policy shall apply prospectively and not violate any contractual obligation.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAs long-term shareholders, we believe that a board chair independent of management, now or upon retirement of the current Executive Chairman, would assist the Board in overseeing Dominion’s necessary strategic transformation to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We strongly commend Dominion for committing to this important target. We are concerned, however, that Dominion’s planned transition from coal is too slow and incompatible with achieving its 2050 target and that these assets are at risk of becoming stranded — Dominion’s plans entail running several coal plants into the 2040s. As summarized in a 2020 Deloitte study: “[T]here are significant gaps between decarbonization targets and the scheduled fossil fuel plant retirements, renewable additions and flexibility requirements needed to achieve full decarbonization. The math doesn’t yet add up.”1 Deloitte was referring to U.S. utilities that have made net zero commitments in general, but we believe this is also the case with Dominion in particular. Our fundamental concern is that Dominion’s CEO, under the supervision of its former CEO, has misaligned incentives to make investments and strategic choices whose payoff — no matter how substantial — is decades into the future. There is an inherent conflict of interest when a current or former CEO chairs the board to which the CEO is accountable. Dominion’s former CEO, Thomas Farrell II, who was recently appointed Executive Chairman, may have a vested interest in the success of the decisions and strategies made under his leadership – and investors will pay the price, if these decisions need to be overturned for Dominion to complete its transformation. Farrell’s sustained authority may also hinder the ability of the new CEO, Robert Blue, to be a change agent and steer the company to achieve its decarbonization goals. Furthermore, Dominion has not announced an end date for Farrell’s service as Executive Chairman (unlike Disney and IBM in 2020). In our view, an independent Board chair is an effective means to hold the CEO accountable for managing the company in close alignment with the long-term interests of its shareowners. It can also help strengthen the quality of discussions in the boardroom. For these reasons, we believe independent Board leadership would assist the Board in overseeing Dominion’s strategic transformation to a low carbon economy. Furthermore, this is an opportune moment for the Board to establish a policy requiring an independent chair upon Farrell’s retirement without risking the reputational risks that can be created by removing a sitting executive from the role of chairman.

In each case, a significant minority of shareholders voted for the Follow This climate targets resolution.

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Programme’s most recent annual “Emissions Gap Report” (November 26, 2019), critical gaps remain between the commitments of national governments and the actions required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policy-makers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying that is inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement presents regulatory, reputational and legal risks to investors. These efforts also present systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, pose a systemic risk to economic stability and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks, and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\nOf particular concern are trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C— as an imperative. We believe that unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of their portfolios.

       " 'Exxon’s existing disclosures are insufficient to assure investors how the company can reconcile its petrochemical expansion plans with increasingly urgent global goals to mitigate certain environmental crises. Shareholders are concerned that Exxon’s planned growth in petrochemicals, rather than reducing risk from climate change, will expose the company and its investors to stranded asset risk, as global action on environmental crises, including climate and plastic pollution, lead to reduced demand for its petroleum-based products.[1]\\nPlastic pollution has become one of society’s most intractable problems with consumers, corporations, and policy makers struggling to address the growing quantities of plastic waste polluting oceans and other ecosystems.[2]\\xa0A recent study found plastic use in the U.S. alone contributed up to 2.2 million metric tons of pollution into the ocean in 2016, more than previously estimated. Existing recycling infrastructure is equipped to recycle only a fraction of plastic waste produced, leaving most plastics to more harmful disposal practices.[3]\\xa0Industry response through groups including the American Chemistry Council (of which Exxon is a member) has been insufficient to stem growing consumer and government concern.[4]\\xa0In response, Consumer Goods companies are increasingly looking to reduce reliance on virgin plastic.[5]\\nWhile Exxon reports that plastic products can help reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,[6]\\xa0recent reports show that emissions across the petrochemical and plastics supply chain contribute significantly to climate change.[7]\\xa0For example, plastic disposal results in high levels of emissions through incineration or other end of life outcomes (these emissions are currently unaccounted for in Exxon’s reporting). Research has found the plastic industry could use as much as 19 percent of earth’s remaining carbon budget, jeopardizing chances of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.[8]\\nExxon’s disclosures indicate the company is continuing to invest in expensive petrochemical-related infrastructure with increasing risk of stranding,[9]\\xa0as plastic demand growth is likely to slow due to government and consumer action to reduce its use. Furthermore, planned infrastructure in the Gulf Coast Plastics Production Corridor, where catastrophic weather events associated with climate change occur frequently,[10]\\xa0risk hazardous emissions releases harmful to human health, and community opposition to petrochemical projects is growing.[11]\\xa0Already, similar projects have stalled or lost value.[12]\\xa0\\xa0\\nShareholders seek to understand if, and how, Exxon is reducing the risk of stranded assets of its petrochemical-based investments as the global response to climate and plastic pollution intensifies. The energy and petrochemical sectors must play a critical role in mitigating environmental impacts related to plastic manufacturing, use, and disposal.\\n[1]\\xa0https://carbontracker.org/reports/the-futures-not-in-plastics/\\n[2]\\xa0https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/climate/oil-kenya-africa-plastics-trade.html\\xa0\\n[3]\\xa0https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/climate/plastic-pollution-oceans.html\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n[4]\\xa0https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled\\xa0\\xa0\\n[5]\\xa0https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4024412/pepsico-switch-recycled-plastic-bottles-european-nations\\n[6]\\xa0https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/-/media/Global/Files/energy-and-carbon-summary/Energy-and-carbon-summary.pdf\\n[7]\\xa0https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf\\n[8]\\xa0https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf\\n[9]\\xa0https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/energy-and-environment/where-we-work/growing-the-gulf/20-billion-gulf-investment-to-create-tens-of-thousands-of-high-paying-jobs#beaumont\\n[10]\\xa0https://planet-tracker.org/tracker-programmes/materials/plastics/#stormy-outlook\\n[11]\\xa0https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/08/28/906822940/millions-of-pounds-of-extra-pollution-were-released-before-laura-made-landfall\\n[12]\\xa0https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-new-orleans-environment-louisiana-0a6353662b4b3019f0b83f577ab21df2\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that ExxonMobil Corporation issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing if and how it is reducing the risk of stranded assets related to environmental impacts of its petrochemical investments.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nThe report should consider the potential impact of public, market, and governmental responses to environmental impacts including plastic pollution, community health, and climate change.\\n',\n",

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.\\n2. Payments by ExxonMobil used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, including in each case the amount of the payment and the recipient.\\n3. Description of management’s and the Board’s decision-making process and oversight for making payments described above.\\nFor purposes of this proposal, a “grassroots lobbying communication” is a communication directed to\\nthe general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. “Indirect lobbying” is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which ExxonMobil is a member.\\nBoth “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. A lobbying activities alignment assessment is not encompassed by this proposal.\\nThe report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on ExxonMobil’s website.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nExxonMobil spent $120,450,000 from 2010 – 2019 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where ExxonMobil also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, ExxonMobil spent $4,226,747 on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2019. Exxon also lobbies abroad, spending between €3,250,000 – 3,499,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2019.\\nExxonMobil belongs to the American Fuel & Petrochem Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce, Consumer Energy Alliance, and National Association of Manufacturers, which altogether spent $122,009,109 on lobbying for 2019. CEA has drawn attention for its involvement in a grassroots campaign that sent emails based on the same template and using “the names and addresses of people without their knowledge.” ExxonMobil does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying.\\nWe believe ExxonMobil’s lack of trade association lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks that could harm long-term value creation. For example, ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, yet a 2019 report found Exxon was one of five companies spending $1 billion as part of a “carefully- managed trend of campaigns designed to portray positive messaging combined with negative policy lobbying on climate change in an effort to maintain public-facing support while simultaneously blocking the creation of binding policies.”1 Highlighting these risks, Norway’s largest private asset manager Storebrand divested from ExxonMobil citing its lobbying practices “amid growing concern about trade groups lobbying to soften green finance rules in Europe.”2\\nAs long-term shareholders, we support transparency, disclosure and accountability in corporate lobbying, and we therefore urge ExxonMobil to expand its disclosure.\\n1\\xa0https://cleantechnica.com/2019/04/01/claims-big-oil-invested-over-1-billion-on-misleading-climate-lobbying-since-paris- labelled-fanciful/\\n2\\xa0https://www.reuters.com/article/climatechange-funds-storebrand/storebrand-divests-out-of-exxon-others-over-climate-lobbying- idUSL8N2FM46M\\n',\n",
       " 'Our Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in 2019, signed a “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” committing our Company to all stakeholders, including “protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainability practices across our businesses.”\\nYet, inconsistent with our Company’s “embrace” of sustainability, Exxon has declined to develop business goals consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and, unlike peers, has not set “net zero emissions” goals for 2050.\\n“Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy” according to the United States’ Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The National Bureau of Economic Research warns if greenhouse gases are not cut in line with the Paris Accord, United States’ GDP could be cut 10.5 percent by 2100. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and Principles for Responsible Investment reports in the paper “Universal Ownership” that over 50 percent of companies’ earnings are at risk from climate costs, creating systemic risk for diversified investors.\\n“Universal investors”—those with highly-diversified portfolios representative of the broad economy—are exposed to growing and widespread climate costs generated by some companies, including Exxon, and ultimately incurred by other companies. The Proponent is quoted in “Universal Ownership:”\\n“A portfolio investor benefiting from a company externalizing costs might experience a reduction in overall returns due to these externalities adversely affecting other investments in the portfolio, and hence overall market return. For a diversified investor, there is no place to hide from these costs: they come back into the portfolio as taxes, insurance premiums, inflated input prices and the physical cost of disasters.” (Seitchik)\\nIt is therefore in investors’ interest to reduce climate externalities to protect long-term returns. And while the board and management may have the discretion to address global sustainability, Exxon appears to prioritize our Company’s financial returns over the impact of climate change on global markets.\\nUnder New Jersey law, the Company can amend its Certificate of Incorporation to become a Benefit Corporation. In doing so, the corporation is required to commit to general public benefit (defined as a “material, positive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole, as assessed against a third-party standard, from the business and operations of a benefit corporation.”) The Company can establish a specific benefit purpose, such as seeking a sustainable global economy by limiting global warming.\\nThe Proponent believes incorporating as a Benefit Corporation would help ensure that the board and management make decisions that more effectively reconcile stockholders’ financial interests in the Company’s returns with the interests of universal investors in minimizing the economic disruption posed by climate change to protect long-term portfolio-wide performance.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board approve an amendment to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to become a Benefit Corporation pursuant to New Jersey law and to submit the proposed amendment to shareholders for approval.\\n',\n",

Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nWe believe:\\nThe role of the CEO and management is to run the company.\\nThe role of the Board of Directors is to provide independent oversight of management and the CEO.\\nThere is a potential conflict of interest for a CEO to be her/his own overseer as Chair while managing the business.\\nExxon Mobil’s CEO Darren Woods serves both as CEO and Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors. We believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporation’s governance structure.\\nChairing and overseeing the Board is a time intensive responsibility. A separate independent Chair also frees the CEO to manage the company and build effective business strategies.\\nAs Andrew Grove, Intel’s former chair, stated, “The separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation. Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he’s an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the Board. The Chairman runs the Board. How can the CEO be his own boss?”\\nIn our view, shareholders are best served by a separate independent Board Chair who provides a balance of power between the CEO and the Board. The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. A combined CEO / Chair creates a potential conflict of interest, resulting in excessive management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of management.\\nNumerous institutional investors recommend separation of these two roles and the number of companies separating these roles is growing.\\nWith the unprecedented climate change challenges facing global energy companies as they face important transitions to a low carbon economy, it is important to ensure our company’s governance is the best it can be, and the board is empowered to provide strong direction and leadership. Exxon Mobil and the industry faces numerous and significant climate related challenges from decisions about developing new oil and gas fields for the market to revising its climate related lobbying.\\nThis resolution to Exxon Mobil received a vote in support of approximately 41% in 2019 and 33% in 2020, a significant showing.

This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where FedEx lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, FedEx spent $2.89 million lobbying in California from 2010\\xa0-\\xa02020.\\nFedEx sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce and also belongs to the Business Roundtable (BRT), which have together spent over $2.0 billion on lobbying since 1998. FedEx does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations and social welfare organizations, or the amounts used for lobbying, including grassroots. Grassroots lobbying does not get reported at the federal level under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and disclosure is uneven or absent in states. And FedEx does not disclose its support for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\\nWe are concerned FedEx’s lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, FedEx publicly supported COVID-19 efforts, but the Chamber lobbied against use of the Defense Production Act for production of personal protective equipment for workers.1 FedEx has drawn scrutiny for its public support for climate sustainability juxtaposed against the Chamber’s lobbying on climate regulation.2 And FedEx signed the BRT Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation, yet also attended the ALEC annual conference reportedly “to work in secret with lawmakers on bills to promote fossil fuels and bust unions.”3\\nWe believe the reputational damage stemming from these misalignment harms long-term value creation.

A Friends of the Earth campaign calling on Home Depot and Lowe’s to stop selling glyphosate-based products has been supported by 66 nonprofits and over 157,000 consumers.\\xa0\\nRegulatory actions are increasing, and the continued sale of certain pesticides will require Home Depot to comply with an increasingly complex patchwork of restrictions. Twenty-five states have some sort of regulation on synthetic pesticides in place and dozens of cities have legislated full or partial bans of glyphosate locally, including Los Angeles County, CA; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL and others.\\xa0\\nFurthermore, Home Depot and Lowe’s have both been sued over insufficient consumer warnings of Roundup’s cancer risk, and the Company could face further legal and financial risk if it does not take action.

Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policymakers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational and legal risks to investors. These efforts present systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, threaten economic stability, and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\nOf particular concern are trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but too often present unnecessary obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius—as an imperative. We believe unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on the value of our portfolio. We see future “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4 degrees Celsius or greater as both unsustainable and unacceptable.\\nWhile we commend Norfolk Southern for setting short-term greenhouse gas emission goals and for considering a science-based reduction target,[1] transporting coal represents one of its primary lines of business: in 2019 shipping coal represented 12 percent of its shipping volume and 15 percent of its revenue.[2]\\xa0According to press reports[3], Norfolk Southern has supported its coal customers by funding lobbying organizations, such as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which work to discredit climate science and oppose most federal climate policies.\\xa0\\nWe believe it is in the interest of shareholders that Norfolk Southern’s management and Board of Directors ensure that its lobbying activities, both directly and indirectly through its trade and other associations, align with the Paris Agreement’s goals and the company’s own climate risk mitigation actions (e.g. emissions targets).

Toxins adhere to plastics consumed by marine species, which potentially transfer to human diets. There could be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050.\\nIn July 2020, the Pew Charitable Trusts released a groundbreaking study, Breaking the Plastic Wave, which concluded that if all current industry and government commitments were met, ocean plastic deposition would be reduced by only 7%. Without immediate and sustained new commitments in eight areas of the plastics value chain, annual flow of plastic into oceans could nearly triple by 2040.\\nImproved recycling will not be sufficient to stem the plastic tide, and must be coupled with upstream activities like reduction in demand, materials redesign, and substitution. “Brand owners, fast-moving consumer goods companies and retailers should lead the transition by committing to reduce at least one-third of plastic demand through elimination, reuse, and new delivery models,” the report states, adding that reducing plastic production is the most attractive solution from environmental, economic, and social perspectives.\\nFood conglomerate Unilever has taken the most significant action by a major company to date, agreeing to cut plastic packaging use overall by 100,000 tons by 2025. PepsiCo has committed to substitute recycled content for 35% of virgin plastic use in its beverage division, but has not set absolute cuts for all plastic packaging.\\nCompanies should disclose the number of units of plastic packaging placed into commerce so stakeholders can track plastic risk exposure levels and measure progress towards managing it.

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the November 2019 “Emissions Gap Report” issued by the United Nations Environment Programme, critical gaps remain between the commitments national governments have made and the actions required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policy- makers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, however, present regulatory, reputational, legal and financial risks to investors. These efforts also exacerbate systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change – as we have seen in abundance in 2020 with wildfires and severe storms – and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris Climate Agreement-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks, and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but, unfortunately, too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Climate Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2 °C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C—as an imperative. We are convinced that unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of their portfolios. We see future “business as usual” scenarios of a 3-4 °C or greater increase in the global average temperature as both unacceptable and uninvestable.\\nIn 2019, two hundred institutional investors managing $6.5 trillion wrote to Phillips 66, seeking information on how the company is managing this critical governance issue. Insufficient information is presently available to help investors understand whether Phillips 66 works to ensure that its lobbying activities, directly, in the company’s name, and indirectly, through trade associations, align with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals, and whether Phillips 66 takes any action to address any misalignments it has found. We believe Philips 66’s reply was not responsive to this request.\\nThus, we urge the Board and management to assess the company’s climate related lobbying and report to shareholders.\\n',\n",

       " 'Description:\\nThe company did not commit but As You Sow is working with both on evaluating methodologies for calculating/disclosing upstream Scope 3 emissions.\\n\\nWhereas:\\nThe energy sector has a critical role to play in mitigating climate risk. The sector is rapidly transitioning away from coal, but growing reliance on natural gas creates ongoing risk. Natural gas is a\\xa0major contributor\\xa0to climate change due to methane leaks occurring throughout the supply chain. In 2018,\\xa0gas contributed\\xa0to an increase in power sector emissions, jeopardizing chances of achieving greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\nDisclosure of indirect GHG emissions from a company’s natural gas supply chain is critical for investors to understand the extent of a company’s climate risk. In the utility sector, where use of natural gas for power generation and distribution is increasing, supply chain emissions constitute a material climate impact and transition risk.\\nCurrently, many utilities’ emission reduction strategies rely on natural gas, highlighting emissions savings over coal during combustion, but ignoring supply chain releases from sources like fugitive methane, venting, and flaring. Recent supply chain studies, however, have concluded that supply chain methane losses are at least\\xa060% higher\\xa0than current Environmental Protection Agency estimates, with gas production in North America likely to have contributed\\xa0one-third of total\\xa0increased emissions globally in recent years. The fossil gas supply chain also\\xa0contributes to climate breakdown\\xa0in other ways—millions of orphan wells\\xa0remain unplugged, leaking methane into the atmosphere.\\nSouthern Company’s\\xa0climate plan\\xa0indicates an intent to continue building out expensive natural gas infrastructure. Southern currently discloses downstream emissions from its customers’ use of natural gas, but does not calculate and disclose indirect GHG releases from upstream sources such as the exploration, production, and transport of natural gas.\\nGiven the material, long-term business risks associated with climate change, and the need for Southern to participate successfully in the low-carbon energy transition, investors believe it is essential that the company provide annual public reporting of the company’s GHG emissions across its full value chain, including indirect upstream emissions. While Southern subsidiary Virginia Natural Gas has\\xa0acknowledged\\xa0some responsibility for those emissions by piloting the purchase of gas from “select, low fugitive emissions wells,” investors lack data to assess the relative impact of such action in relation to its continued build out of, and reliance on, natural gas infrastructure.\\n\\nResolved:\\nIn order that investors can better understand and measure the material, long-term climate risks associated with our company’s GHG emissions, shareholders request that Southern provide annual public reporting of the indirect upstream GHG emissions from its supply chain. The reporting should be prepared at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information.\\n',\n",

Rowe Price Group is a respected leader in the financial services industry with several policies and practices addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics.\\xa0\\nTROW’s “Policy Statement on Environmental, Social, and Governance Issues” describes how “ESG risk considerations” are incorporated into investment decisions. That policy expresses TROW’s belief that ESG issues can influence investment risk and return, thus affirming that such issues must be addressed carefully by investors.\\nIn its “Guidelines for Incorporating Environmental and Social Factors,” TROW acknowledges the importance of climate change risk: “We believe that speaking with company managements and other stakeholders about climate change is a good way to gather valuable investment insights as to the management’s process for assessing long-term risks and helps reinforce the notion that climate-related risk assessment should remain a priority.”\\nTROW seems knowledgeable about the risks of climate change and the need for action by companies.\\nTROW’s subsidiaries, which vote proxies, are guided by clients’ economic interests and support certain governance reforms proposed by shareholders who believe that these issues affect shareholder value. We believe ESG issues such as climate change risk also have a profound impact on shareholder value.\\nTROW is a member of the Principles for Responsible Investment, a global network of investors and asset owners representing more than $100 trillion in assets. One of the Principles encourages investors to vote conscientiously on ESG issues.\\nYet the 2020 publicly reported proxy voting records for TROW’s subsidiaries reveal consistent votes against the vast majority of climate-focused shareholder proposals, such as requests for enhanced disclosure or adoption of greenhouse gas reduction goals, even when independent experts advance a strong business and economic case for support. In contrast, funds managed by investment firms such as JPMorgan, Columbia, and State Street supported the majority of climate-focused resolutions in 2020. TROW’s own “2020 Aggregate Proxy Voting Summary” reports only 17 percent support for resolutions on environmental topics.\\nThe voting practices of subsidiaries appear inconsistent with our Company’s statements about ESG and climate change. This contradiction poses reputational risk with both clients and investors. Moreover, proxy voting practices that do not properly take account of climate change seem to ignore significant company-specific and economy-wide risks associated with negative impacts of climate change.\\nInvestors seek information on whether the practices of TROW and its subsidiaries are suited to address material ESG considerations in proxy voting.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareowners request that the Board of Directors initiate a review and issue a report on the proxy voting policies and practices of\\xa0its subsidiaries related to climate change, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, and including an assessment of any incongruities between the Company’s public statements and pledges regarding climate change (including ESG risk considerations associated with climate change), and the voting policies and practices of its subsidiaries.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Toxins adhere to plastics consumed by marine species, which potentially transfer to human diets. There could be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050.\\nRecently, the Pew Charitable Trusts released a groundbreaking study, Breaking the Plastic Wave, which concluded that if all current industry and government commitments were met, ocean plastic deposition would be reduced by only 7%.\\xa0Without immediate and sustained new commitments throughout the plastics value chain, annual flow of plastic into oceans could nearly triple in twenty years.\\xa0\\nImproved recycling will not be sufficient to stem the plastic tide, and must be coupled with upstream activities like reduction in demand, materials redesign, and substitution. “Brand owners, fast-moving consumer goods companies and retailers should lead the transition by committing to reduce at least one-third of plastic demand through elimination, reuse, and new delivery models,” the report states, adding that reducing plastic production is the most attractive solution from environmental, economic, and social perspectives.\\xa0\\nFood conglomerate Unilever has taken the most significant action by a major company to date, agreeing to cut plastic packaging use overall by 100,000 tons by 2025. PepsiCo has committed to substitute recycled content for 35% of virgin plastic use in its beverage division. Target has no goal to reduce use of plastic packaging.\\xa0\\nTarget does not fully disclose its plastic packaging data, such as how much flexible plastic packaging the company uses.\\xa0Flexible packaging, which cannot be recycled, represents 59% of all plastic production but an outsized 80% of plastic leaking into oceans. Companies should disclose plastic packaging data, including types of plastic used and number of units of plastic packaging placed into commerce so stakeholders can track plastic risk exposure levels and measure progress towards managing it.\\nThe company received a score of D+ in an As You Sow study ranking corporate leadership on plastic pollution. This ranking demonstrates that Target lags in its commitments, specifically on overall cuts in plastic packaging, and in facilitating recyclability of its flexible packaging by 2025.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the board of directors issue a report by December 2021 on plastic packaging, estimating the amount of plastics released to the environment by our use of plastic packaging, from the manufacture of plastic source materials, through disposal or recycling, and describing any company strategies or goals to reduce the use of plastic packaging to reduce these impacts.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponents note that the report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting confidential information, and include an assessment of the reputational, financial, and operational risks associated with continuing to use substantial amounts of plastic packaging while plastic pollution grows unabated.\\xa0In the board’s discretion, the report could also evaluate opportunities for dramatically reducing the amount of plastics used in our packaging through redesign or substitution.\\n',\n",
       " 'Climate change presents significant risks to restaurant businesses and their supply chains. The 2018 National Climate Assessment found “climate change presents numerous challenges to sustaining and enhancing crop productivity, livestock health, and the economic vitality of rural communities,” and rising temperatures are “the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of U.S. agriculture.” Not only is agricultural production vulnerable to climate change, it also reportedly contributes up to 23 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, making it vulnerable to regulatory actions designed to mitigate climate change.\\nWendy’s is the third largest quick service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment. Thus, regulatory efforts to reduce emissions from agriculture and the impacts of climate change on agricultural production both constitute material risks to Wendy’s.\\nProponents commend our company’s efforts to reduce emissions from its restaurants, packaging, and transportation. However, Wendy’s disclosures regarding its beef supply chain focus primarily on animal welfare, antibiotics, and food safety. Wendy’s is therefore only addressing a small fraction of its total carbon footprint. One recent analysis shows emissions from the supply chains of food and beverage companies are, on average, 5.9 times greater than direct emissions.\\xa0\\nCompetitors including Chipotle, McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Yum! Brands are taking responsibility for emissions throughout their full value chains and working to align their total carbon footprints with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal to limit global temperature increases to well below 2°C. Many other companies sourcing significant volumes of beef are doing so as well, including Cargill, Tesco, Tyson Foods, and Walmart. These companies are measuring their full value chain emissions and pursuing science-based goals to manage them. They are using a variety of strategies, such as working with farmers on low-carbon agricultural techniques, focusing resiliency efforts on at-risk producers, and collaborating with other companies to scale efforts.\\nDeveloping a plan to measure and reduce Wendy’s full value chain emissions footprint is a prudent and vital course of action that will help our company reduce risks associated with climate change, including production and supply disruptions, and help prepare it for future carbon-related regulations and industry developments.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request Wendy’s Board of Directors issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing whether, and how, the Company plans to measure and reduce its total contribution to climate change, including emissions from its supply chain, and align its operations with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature increases well below 2°C.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nShareholders encourage the Board of Directors, in preparing the report, to consider the benefits and drawbacks of:\\nAdopting GHG emissions reduction targets for Wendy’s full carbon footprint;\\nIncreasing the scale, pace, and rigor of initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of Wendy’s supply chain;\\nThe potential impacts of any considerations regarding increasing the use of plant-based protein.\\n',\n",

Also, that the company's CEO and/or at least one other senior executive’s remuneration arrangements incorporate progress towards achieving the company’s GHG reduction targets as a KPI determining performance-linked compensation (requires meeting relevant long, medium, and short term targets for Scope 1 – 3 emissions, consistent with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner).\\nWhile Valero has set near term GHG reduction targets,[7]\\xa0it has not reported a renumeration structure that links progress toward achieving such targets with compensation awards – a governance best practice for reducing climate risk.

One of the Principles encourages investors to incorporate ESG considerations into proxy voting.\\nVanguard’s stewardship unit votes proxies and has actively supported numerous governance reforms proposed by shareholders, stating it is guided by clients’ economic interests and believes corporate governance practices are one driver of investment performance. We believe issues like climate change can also have a profound impact on shareholder value.\\nVanguard’s 2019 Investment Stewardship Report noted that climate risk is becoming a growing focus for the firm’s engagement strategy, evidenced by discussions regarding long-term climate-related risks with 258 companies in carbon intensive industries. In its report, Vanguard states “material risks such as climate…can damage a company’s long-term value. If a company’s practices, organizational culture, or products put people’s health, safety, or dignity at risk, they can pose a financial risk to investors too.”\\nThe firm’s 2018 Investment Stewardship Report features a case study of three climate-related shareholder proposals the firm supported, selected as evidence of Vanguard’s approach to climate risk oversight and strategy. A 2019 Semiannual Engagement Update document highlighted two separate climate-related proposals Vanguard supported.\\nVanguard seems concerned about the risks of climate change and the need for urgent action by companies.\\nYet its 2019 proxy voting record reveals votes against the majority of climate related resolutions (voting in favor of only 6 of 52 such resolutions), including requests for enhanced disclosure or adoption of greenhouse gas reduction goals, even when independent experts advance a strong business and economic case for support.\\nIn contrast funds managed by investment firms such as Alliance Bernstein, Allianz, Eaton Vance, Legg Mason, MFS, Nuveen, PIMCO, and Wells Fargo supported the majority of climate-related resolutions.\\nVanguard’s voting practices appear inconsistent with its statements about the risks to companies posed by climate change and ways business can identify solutions. This contradiction poses reputational risk for the company with both clients and investors. Moreover, such proxy voting practices seem to ignore significant company-specific and economy-wide risks associated with negative impacts of climate change that can have direct impact on shareholder value.\\nWe believe it is Vanguard’s fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change quantitatively affects portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate relate to shareholder value, and vote accordingly. Thus we request this review of Vanguard’s 2019 proxy voting record.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareowners request that the Board of Directors initiate a review assessing Vanguard’s 2019 proxy voting record and evaluate the Company’s proxy voting policies and guiding criteria related to climate change, including any recommended future changes.

Toxins adhere to plastics consumed by marine species, which potentially transfer to human diets. There could be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050.\\nRecently, the Pew Charitable Trusts released a groundbreaking study,\\xa0Breaking the Plastic Wave, which concluded that if all current industry and government commitments were met, ocean plastic deposition would be reduced by only 7%.\\xa0 Without immediate and sustained new commitments throughout the plastics value chain, annual flow of plastic into oceans could nearly triple in just twenty years.\\nImproved recycling will not be sufficient to stem the plastic tide, and must be coupled with upstream activities like reduction in demand, materials redesign, and substitution. “Brand owners, fast-moving consumer goods companies and retailers should lead the transition by committing to reduce at least one-third of plastic demand through elimination, reuse, and new delivery models,” the report states, adding that reducing plastic production is the most attractive solution from environmental, economic, and social perspectives.\\nFood conglomerate Unilever has taken the most significant action by a major company to date, agreeing to cut plastic packaging use overall by 100,000 tons by 2025. PepsiCo has committed to substitute recycled content for 35% of virgin plastic use in its beverage division. Walmart has no goal to reduce use of plastic packaging.\\nDespite Walmart’s goal to use entirely reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025, the company uses 37% flexible packaging, which cannot be recycled. Flexible packaging represents 59% of all plastic production but an outsized 80% of plastic actually leaking into oceans. The company has failed to take substantive action on its promise to explore reusable packaging, with no reported reusables pilots in the U.S.\\nThe company received a score of D+ in an\\xa0As You Sow\\xa0study ranking corporate leadership on plastic pollution.

       " 'Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a common class of refrigerants, are super pollutants with global warming potentials (GWP) hundreds to thousands of times greater than CO2. Walmart reported over three million tons of HFC-related GHG emissions in 2019 alone - a fifteen percent yearly increase that accounts for over 47 percent of the Company’s gross global scope 1 carbon footprint. HFCs are found across Walmart’s operations as the critical element in refrigerators, chillers, and cooling and air conditioning systems in stores and vehicles.\\xa0\\nResearch shows a global phase out of HFCs could preclude up to one-half degree Celsius of warming by 2100. More aggressively addressing HFC emissions would help Walmart achieve its broader climate goals. Walmart has a vague intention towards “improving the performance of our refrigeration systems” and recently announced it is \"transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling … in its stores, clubs, and data and distribution centers by 2040.” Proponents believe these statements lack rigor and clarity. There is no consensus definition for “low-impact” and 2040 is out of sync with global regulations and stakeholder expectations. Strategies to address refrigerant emissions include:\\nReplacing HFC refrigerants with ultra-low GWP and non-HFC substances,\\xa0\\nLimiting leakage and ensuring end of life refrigerant recovery by use of good management practices,\\xa0\\nIncreasing refrigeration efficiency,\\xa0\\nEstablishing quantitative refrigeration targets and action plans.\\xa0\\nThe Consumer Goods Forum, of which Walmart is a member, is committed to phasing out harmful HFCs and has demonstrated ultra-low GWP refrigerants can be cost- and energy-efficient alternatives. Aldi has over 300 HFC-free stores and has committed to using HFC-free technologies in new stores and in remodeling projects. Target reports having installed over 10,300 HFC-free units in its stores.\\xa0\\nThe globally ratified Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol mandates a phase out of HFCs beginning with high-income countries in 2019. U.S. lawmakers are considering similar actions. NGO groups have begun campaigning against Walmart’s vague refrigerant strategy.\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Walmart issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing if and how it plans to limit its impact on climate change by increasing the scale, pace and rigor of its plans to reduce refrigerants released from its operations.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nThe requested report is intended to address refrigerants released from equipment used in Walmart operations, i.e., refrigerators, chillers, and cooling and air conditioning systems in stores and company vehicles, but exclude refrigerants attributable to the sale of products in Walmart stores.

       " \"0\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED: Shareholders of 3M Corporation (the Company'') request that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee should describe in the Company's proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies with this requested policy. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan.\\nSupporting Statement:Like at many companies, our Company's Compensation Committee uses peer group benchmarks of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These target pay amounts are then subject to performance adjustments. To ensure that our Company's CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company's overall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should also consider the pay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts. This proposal does not require the Compensation Committee to use other employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation targets. Under this proposal, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine how other employee pay should impact CEO compensation targets. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks and/or any other metric to set CEO compensation target amounts. Over time, using peer group benchmarks to set CEO compensation can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies have targeted their CEO's pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher. (Charles Elson and Craig Ferrere, Executive Superstars, Peer Groups and Overcompensation, Journal of Corporation Law, Spring 2013).The current system of using peer group benchmarks, without taking into account the pay grades or salary ranges of all company employees, when determining CEO compensation has had the effect of CEO pay far outpacing that of average employees. In 2018, the average S&P 500 CEO made 287 times that of their median employee. For our Company, the CEO/median employee ratio calculated in 2018 was 302 to 1. According to the 2006 report The State of Working America the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay has risen from 35 to 1 in 1979, to 71 to 1 in 1989, to 248 to 1 in 1998. The current system of determining CEO compensation without taking into account the pay of average company employees has led to glaring inequality between the workers who make our company what it is and the man or woman who sits at the top.\\n\",\n",

(AbbVie) shareholders request that the Compensation Committee of the board of directors publish a report (at reasonable expense, within a reasonable time, and omitting confidential or propriety information) assessing the feasibility of incorporating public concern over high drug prices into the senior executive compensation arrangements described in AbbVie's annual proxy materials.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement To reward the creation of long-term value, incentive compensation arrangements for senior executives of branded pharmaceutical companies should promote responsible risk management. A key strategic risk now facing pharmaceutical firms is backlash against the high price of medicines. The effects of high drug prices on patient access, government payer budgets and the broader health care system have kept drug prices in the public spotlight, especially as campaigning for 2020 presidential and congressional elections intensifies. A 2019 Credit Suisse analyst report stated that US drug price rises contributed 33% of industry net income growth in 2018 and noted strong political pressure to reduce absolute drug prices. The report ranked AbbVie as one of the companies at greatest risk from regulatory changes that have been floated, such as using international reference pricing and eliminating Medicare rebates, and identified Humira as benefiting substantially from high rebates. (Global Pharmaceuticals, Future of US Drug Rebates Under Review, Apr. 29, 2019, at 4, 6-7, 11) One estimate pegged the increase in US healthcare costs from AbbVie's January 2018 9.7% price increase for Humira at $1 billion for 2018 alone. (https://splinternews.com/your-meds-dont-have-to-cost-this-much-1830657097) We are concerned that AbbVie's senior executive incentive compensation arrangements may not encourage consideration of risks created by high prices. For example, 80% of CEO Richard Gonzalez's annual bonus is determined by one-year financial metrics, including net revenue, income before taxes and Humira sales, while only 20% depends on R&D/lnnovation. (2019 Proxy Statement, at 38) Although the final vesting of performance share awards occurs after a three-year cycle, performance on one of the two metrics, earnings per share, depends on meeting three separate annual targets. (See id. at 53-54) Excessive dependence on drug price increases and tactics like high rebates that limit competition create significant risks, which may be exacerbated when price hikes drive large senior executive payouts. Accordingly, we believe it is advisable for the Compensation Committee to explore incorporating measures that relate to the financial and strategic risks created by high drug prices into senior executive compensation arrangements. This Proposal gives the compensation committee total discretion in selecting potential measures and in analyzing the feasibility of incorporating them. By way of illustration, though, such measures could reward executives for increasing access or limit the extent to which price increases can be used to meet revenue and income targets.We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal.\\n\",\n",

The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of men. This disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career. Intersecting race, the gap for African American and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059, Africa American women until 2224, and Latina women until 2224.United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women, minorities and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but mostly ignore median pay gaps. Regulation in the United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Adobe reported a 19 percent median base pay gap and a 44.7 percent bonus pay gap for its United Kingdom operations, but has not published median information for its global operations.Adobe reports women and minorities earn 100 percent of the compensation received by men and non-minorities on an equal pay basis. Yet, that statistically adjusted number is only half the story, failing to consider how discrimination affects opportunity. The objective of this proposal - median pay gap disclosure - addresses the structural bias that affects the jobs women and minorities hold, particularly when white men hold most higher paying jobs. Adobe has announced a goal of opportunity parity, but fails to publish median pay data to track that parity.Women account for 24 percent of Adobe's leadership. Mercer finds actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling. Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.Public policy risk is of concern, not only in the United Kingdom, but in the United States. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends before Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request Adobe report on the company's global median gender/racial pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent.

For example, AAG spent $149,000 lobbying in Washington for 20182 and $464,383 on lobbying in California from 2010 - 2018.3AAG serves on the board of Airlines for America (A4A), which spent $15,133,100 on lobbying for 2017 and 2018.4 A4A's lobbying over passenger facility charges5 and against Massachusetts sick leave law6 has attracted media attention. AAG is also a member of the Aerospace Works for Washington, which lobbied against efforts to make $8.7 billion in Washington state aerospace tax breaks dependent on maintaining minimum employment levels in the state.7 AAG does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying.We are concerned that AAG's lack of lobbying and trade association disclosure presents reputational risks. For example, AAG believe its success in part depends on its ability to develop relationships with customers by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, yet A4A successfully lobbied against legislation to mandate 'reasonable and proportional' baggage and change fees.8 As stockholders, we believe that companies should ensure there is alignment between their own positions and their lobbying, including through trade associations.\\n\",\n",

(Alexion) issue a report describing the company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies, performance, and improvement targets and quantitative metrics. This report should be updated annually, be prepared at reasonable cost, and omit proprietary information.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nTracking and reporting on ESG practices strengthens a company's ability to address controversial policy issues such as reputational risks related to patient access to medicine to better compete and adapt in today's global business environment. Additionally, it allows companies to better integrate and capture value from existing sustainability efforts, identify gaps and opportunities in policies and practices, enhance company-wide communications, and recruit and retain employees.\\n\\nSupport for sustainability reporting continues to gain momentum: The Governance & Accountability Institute reports 86% of S&P 500 companies1 and 60% of Russell 1000 peers2 engaged in sustainability\\nreporting in 2018. One of the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is to seek “appropriate disclosure on ESG issues”;3\\nthe PRI has more than 2,300 signatories with over $86 trillion in assets under management.4\\n\\nIn spite of this trend, Alexion’s current “corporate responsibility” section of the company’s website is limited to 650 words, linking to only two external, and also brief, documents. For example, 47 words are\\ndedicated to “Our People” make such statements as “Health, Safety, and Wellness: A culture that promotes physical and mental well-being” which does not allow investors to assess whether the company is effectively managing its human capital. Likewise, the sections dedicated to patients comprises 154 words, again insufficient for investors to assess how the company is managing potentially material risks.\\n\\nThe reporting requested in the resolved clause would, by contrast, address material ESG issues. Guidance could be drawn from existing resources and reporting recommendations such as the Global\\nReporting Initiative, CDP, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board in identifying topics to be discussed in this report. These widely accepted platforms suggest topics such as operational environmental impacts, employee health & safety, and supply chain management.\\n\\nIn closing, as shareholders, we believe it is prudent for Alexion to disclose how it is managing its ESG impacts, which can pose significant reputational, legal, regulatory, and financial risk to the company and\\nits shareholders. Without appropriate disclosure, investors and other stakeholders cannot adequately assess how Alexion is managing its material ESG risks and opportunities.

       " \"0\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED, that shareholders of Alphabet Inc. urge the Board of Directors to report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omittingconfidential and proprietary information, on the use of contractual provisions requiring direct and contract employees at Alphabetto arbitrate employment-related claims. The report should specify the proportion of the workforce, subject to such provisions; thenumber of employment-related arbitration claims initiated and decided in favor of the employee, in each case in the previous calendaryear; and any changes in policy or practice Alphabet has made, or intends to make, as a result of California's ban on agreeing toarbitration as a condition of employment.\\nSupporting Statement:Recently, public attention has focused on companies' use of agreements requiring employees to pursue employment-related claims,including sexual harassment claims, through arbitration. High-profile sexual harassment cases involving Fox News, Google and Uberhighlighted the impact of these agreements. A robust public debate has ensued, including responses by legislators, regulators andstate attorneys general.Mandatory arbitration precludes employees from suing in court for wrongs like wage theft, discrimination and harassment, andrequires them to submit to private arbitration, which has been found to favor companies and discourage claims.In 2018, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Alphabet for sexual harassment (see https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/9-25-18c.cfm).A bill to end mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims passed the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2019, and56 state and territorial attorneys general voiced support for it. A 2019 article characterized the movement to end forced arbitrationas having swept Silicon Valley, with employee walk-outs and company policy changes (https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-has-a-new-law-against-mandatory-14511832.php).California recently banned the practice of requiring arbitration agreements as a condition of employment and Washington Stateenacted a law in 2018 invalidating contracts requiring arbitration of sexual harassment or assault claims.Because arbitration is private and contractual, arbitrating employment-related claims can allow a toxic culture to flourish, increasingthe severity of eventual consequences and harming employee morale. Confidentiality provisions can prevent an employee's lawyerfrom using knowledge of wrongdoing to identify other victims.In response to a similar shareholder proposal in 2019, Alphabet refused to extend its ban on mandatory arbitration of employmentclaims enacted at Google in February 2019 to other Alphabet-owned businesses, such as Verily, and to Google contract workers.The information sought in this Proposal would allow shareholders to assess the proportion of the workforce subject to mandatoryarbitration of employment-related together with the risks posed by the use of such provisions.Our intent with respect to workforce is similar to that of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in its UK Corporate GovernanceCode. According to the FRC, This term has been carefully chosen to capture the complexity and diversity of modern contractualrelationships between companies and individuals undertaking work for them. The culture of the company, its strategy and values,and decisions made by the board and senior management, will have impact on all those paid to work for the company\\n\",\n",

At its discretion, the Boardshould consider creating an advisory body of independent subject matter experts to aid the Committee in its oversight responsibilities,publishing a formal charter for the Committee and a summary of its functions, and directing the Committee to issue periodic reports.\\nSupporting Statement:The 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) call on companies to undertake human rightsdue diligence to identify, prevent, and mitigate the most severe risks to people in connection with their business.Global technology companies bear unique responsibilities in this regard. The United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rightsstated, Digital technology already delivers many benefits. Its value for human rights and development...is enormous...But we cannotignore the dark side. I cannot express it more strongly than this: The digital revolution is a major global human rights issue. Itsunquestionable benefits do not cancel out its unmistakable risks.1This is especially true for Alphabet. Its technologies, products, and services have transformed our daily lives and the global economy.However, they can pose human rights risks which endanger stakeholders including customers, employees, suppliers, and broadercommunities. Examples include:Proliferation digital surveillance by amassing and in some cases, sharing sensitive user information, raising significant risks toprivacy, which are heightened by the Company's recent moves into health, location, and financial data;2 andExacerbating bias, reinforcing discrimination, or facilitating disinformation, harassment, hate speech, incitements to violencethrough algorithms that show user-targeted content.3Currently, Google's Code of Conduct,4 applicable only to its own operations, and its Supplier Code of Conduct 5 do mention certainhuman rights issues. Yet Alphabet has not articulated an enterprise-wide commitment to respect human rights, and its governancestructure has drawn criticism for failing to adequately oversee broad human rights risks.6While the Audit Committee has oversight authority over operation infrastructure including data privacy,7 and the 2019 Proxy Statementnoted that the Board provides Ongoing Monitoring of Societal Impact,8 Proponents believe this patchwork is insufficient to holisticallyidentify and address human rights issues, leaving policy and due diligence gaps that expose Alphabet, its investors, and the individualsand communities it touches-to human right risks. Consequently, greater Board oversight is imperative Proponents believe that taking these steps would be in the best interest of all stakeholders and encourage all shareholders to support this proposal.\\n\",\n",
       " \"WHEREAS: Studies suggest that companies that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into business strategyreduce reputational, legal, and regulatory risks and improve long-term performance. Leading companies have integrated sustainabilitymetrics into executive pay plans, among them Unilever and Walmart. The UN Principles for Responsible Investment (2012) state thatconsidering ESG factors in compensation can help protect long-term shareholder value.Diversity, inclusion, and equity are key components of business sustainability and success:McKinsey research shows that companies in the top quartiles for gender and racial/ethnic diversity were more likely to have aboveaverage financial returns (Diversity Matters, McKinsey & Company, 2015).In a 2013 Catalyst report, diversity was positively associated with more customers, increased sales revenue, and greater relativeprofits.Yet technology companies have not seized this opportunity. Underrepresented people of color hold just 9 percent of technical rolesin the sector (Intel/Dalberg, 2016). Women hold 36 percent of entry-level tech jobs and just 19 percent of C-suite positions (Womenin the Workplace, McKinsey, 2016).The tech diversity crisis threatens worker safety, talent retention, product development, and customer service. These human capitalrisks are playing out as controversies and employee unrest at Alphabet:In 2018, approximately 20,000 workers walked out protesting Alphabet's mishandling of sexual misconduct cases.In 2019, more than 2,000 Googlers signed a petition to remove a member of the company's newly formed council on artificialintelligence ethics for alleged anti-trans and anti-immigrant views. The board was disbanded after only a week, in response to theoutcry. (Google loses diversity chief amid unrest over workplace issues, CNET, April 2019)Alphabet has taken steps to address inclusion, but risks remain as our Company remains predominantly white and male. Accordingto Google's 2019 diversity report, underrepresented people of color account for only 7.3 percent of Google's tech workforce and only6.6. percent of leadership. In contrast, Silicon Valley's lower-wage subcontracted workforce (e.g. janitors, cafeteria workers, shuttledrivers) is 58 percent Black or Latinx, earning on average $19,900 yearly (UC Santa Cruz, 2016) and often facing housing instability.Investors seek clarity regarding how Alphabet drives improvement and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability.Clearly disclosed, comprehensive links among sustainability, diversity, and executive compensation would enhance Alphabet'sapproach.Peers such as Microsoft, Intel, and IBM have set diversity goals and begun linking parts of compensation to such goals. Alphabetshould consider changing to keep pace with leaders and to strengthen human capital management.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board Compensation Committee prepare a report assessing the feasibility of integratingsustainability metrics, including metrics regarding diversity among senior executives, into performance measures or vesting conditionsthat may apply to senior executives under the Company's compensation plans or arrangements.

PENAmerica said: we need far more transparency regarding which sites Google has removed from its search results, as well as theinternal evaluation and criteria that Google used for determining whether these sites should be taken down.ARTICLE 19 submitted expert opinion to Russia's Constitutional Court regarding the removal of articles on hate crimes from Googlesearch, saying search engine operators are prohibited by the Law from disclosing any information pertaining to the applicant'srequest...this constitutes a disproportionate restriction on the right to freedom of expression and a breach of their rights to a fairtrial and to an effective remedy.In addition, reports of proposed amendments to India's Information Technology Act indicate that it may soon be mandatory for firmslike Alphabet to proactively deploy technology to suppress content.Google states its Transparency Reports provide a glimpse at the wide range of content removal requests that we receive, but theyare not comprehensive.In 2018, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression's report stated: the authoritative global standard forensuring freedom of expression on [companies'] platforms is human rights law, not the varying laws of States or their own privateinterests, and [companies] should re-evaluate their content standards accordingly.Proponents suggest the report assess the feasibility of:Incorporating into Google's Transparency Report the substantive content of government requests, including whether the requestwas met, and criteria used to guide decisions;Notifying customers of content affected by government requests.\\n\",\n",

Civilrights advocates have criticized Alphabet for failing to address hate speech that targets marginalized groups. The Anti-DefamationLeague found a significant number of channels on YouTube's platform continue to disseminate anti-Semitic and white supremacistcontent despite the company's June 2019 crackdown on hate speech.The Christchurch terrorist attack in New Zealand, broadcast on YouTube, led to a global call to limit the spread of extremist content.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said: We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said onthem is not the responsibility of the place where they are published...It cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.In 2019, nearly 1500 employees - Googlers for Human Rights - petitioned Google to commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR withany infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses, comparingGoogle's role today to IBM's role to enabling Nazis during the Holocaust.A 2019 Amnesty International report concluded Google's surveillance-based business model is incompatible with the right to privacyand poses a serious threat to a range of other human rights. The report said algorithms can result in Google...actively promotingor amplifying abusive, discriminatory or hateful content.Google was fined a record 170 million dollars by the Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General Letitia James overYouTube's violation of children's privacy. James said: Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked and servedtargeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in. These companies put children at risk and abused their power.As fiduciaries, our Board is responsible for stewardship of business performance and long term strategic planning, in light of riskfactors like widespread violations of human and civil rights.

       " \"WHEREAS, Alphabet may face business risks related to employee morale and user trust due to insufficient protection for employeesvoicing ethical and human rights concerns regarding company practices.Resourcing whistleblower protections is vital to a well-functioning system. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor has reporteda major problem with whistleblower protections is the lack of resources and proper tracking of complaints, as well as a complicatedpatchwork of regulations that aim to protect whistleblowers. And according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment, A non-retaliation policy alone, without a system to ensure its respect (such as disciplinary action against those whoretaliate), is unlikely to encourage reporting.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED, shareholders request the Board of Directors to issue a report (within a reasonable time, at reasonable cost, and excludingconfidential information) evaluating the company's whistleblower policies and practices and assessing the feasibility of expandingthose policies and practices above and beyond current levels to cover, for example, information concerning the public interest and/or information concerning rights contained in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.\\nSupporting Statement:Furthermore, a specific focus on protecting human rights is a necessary component of a system of strong whistleblower protections.A United Nations Report on whistleblower protection recommended: Disclosure of human rights or humanitarian law violations shouldnever be the basis of penalties of any kind. A 2018 letter from fourteen human rights groups urged Google to Guarantee protectionsfor whistle-blowers and other employees speaking out where they see the company is failing its commitments to human rights.New York University's Al Now recommended companies provide protections for conscientious objectors, employee organizing, andethical whistleblowers. In October 2019, the European Union adopted a rule to protect whistleblowers in several new areas, includingprivacy and data protection.This topic is one that Alphabet is currently grappling with. In 2017, Google asked the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) tooverturn a policy that allowed workers to organize on company systems and prevented companies from retaliating; in 2019, aspart of a settlement agreement with NLRB, Google must tell workers they will not be retaliated against for exercising their rights. InNovember 2019, employees protested actions of the company's investigations team, claiming it was illegal retaliation for organizing,violating the NLRB settlement, and labeling Google's actions brute force intimidation. Google then reportedly fired workers activein organizing, reportedly for violating data security policies.These controversies clearly touch on how the company is addressing human rights issues. Reporting indicates that many of theemployees who have resigned in a very public manner discussed in their resignation letters retaliation and punishments related tospeaking up about the ethics and human rights implications of company projects and business - e.g. China, Project Maven, andother projects.A George Washington 2019 report found whistleblowing report volume is associated with fewer and lower amounts of governmentfines and material lawsuits.\\n\",\n",

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.2. Payments by Altria used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.3. Altria's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.4. Description of the decision making process and oversight by management and the Board for making payments described in section 2 and 3 above.For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Altria is a member.Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.The report shall be presented to the Nominating, Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee and posted on Altria's website.\\nSupporting Statement:We encourage transparency in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. Altria does not provide easily accessible aggregated lobbying expenditure information on its website. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Altria spent over $10 million in 2018 on federal lobbying. This does not include lobbying at the state level, where Altria reportedly lobbies in all 50 states. As of September 2019, Altria and Juul, in which Altria has a 35% stake and which controls over 70% of the e-cigarette market, together spent more on lobbying this year than the rest of the tobacco industry combined. https://www.investopedia.com/e-cigarette-lobbying-fires-up-as-juul-spends-millions-4771268Altria does not comprehensively disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. Altria only discloses trade association payments used for political contributions. This leaves a serious disclosure gap, as trade associations generally spend far more on lobbying than on political contributions. Nor does Altria disclose payments to tax-exempt organizations, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), that write and endorse model legislation.

Any policy that discriminates against delivery partners, content creators, or customers based on social, political, or religious views obstructs the near-limitless potential that Amazon's innovative approach has unlocked.One example of Amazon's choice to discriminate against social, political, or religious views is its exclusion of U.S. Internal Revenue Service-approved charities from receiving customer-selected donations through the Amazon Smile Program. This program has donated over $100 million to nonprofits, making it one of the largest sources of consumer earmarked charitable support in the United States.1 Amazon's implementation of viewpoint-discriminatory policies in the Smile Program itself stems from a reliance on viewpoint-discriminatory, partisan, and discredited sources.2We are also concerned that the Company's failure to respect diverse social, political, and religious viewpoints in the Smile program is symptomatic of a tendency to discriminate against such views more broadly. For example, although Amazon's policies state we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable, it has recently begun removing books based on customer objections.3 And, while Amazon publicly affirms its commitment to different perspectives, it officially opposed a shareholder proposal to gauge progress in ideological diversity on the Board of Directors in its 2019 proxy materials.The shareholders should be aware of the extent to which discrimination against social, political, or religious views by Amazon in its partnerships, content policies, and options for customer-selected charitable donations may jeopardize Amazon's current market-dominance and may negatively affect important social dynamics beyond Amazon's immediate business impact.We therefore ask and recommend that the report called for include, among other issues at board and management discretion: 1. Risks associated with relying on a partisan and external source to determine eligibility for charitable support from third-party customers. 2. Risks associated with regulating content on the platform based on its social, political, or religious viewpoint. 3. A full evaluation of viewpoint bias and associated risks to ensure that Amazon is making balanced decisions and that it is acting consistent with its commitment to diversity.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Whereas: The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy 1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent that of men. This disparity can equal half a million dollars over a career. Intersecting race, the gap for African American and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women overall will not reach pay equity until 2059, African American women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224.Research suggests diverse leadership leads to superior stock performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling. Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.Women account for 41.7 percent of our company's workforce, but only 26.8 percent of leadership. Actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.Assessing if a company has pay gaps requires analyzing both equal pay and equal opportunity by using adjusted and unadjusted (median) pay data. The objective of this proposal - median pay gap disclosure - addresses the structural bias affecting the jobs women and minorities hold, when white men hold most higher paying jobs. It is the key metric used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Economic Forum, and United States Department of Labor.Companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay numbers, assessing the pay of men and women, minorities and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but ignore unadjusted median pay gaps.

       " \"Full disclosure of amazon.com’s (“Amazon”) lobbying activities and expenditures is needed to assess whether such lobbying fully serves shareholder best interest, and is consistent with Amazon’s policy goals.\\n\\nResolved:\\nAmazon shareholders request the preparation of an annual report that discloses Amazon’s:\\nPolicies and procedures that govern lobbying, both direct and indirect, and its grassroots lobbying communications.\\nPayments that are used for: (A) direct or indirect lobbying, or (B) grassroots lobbying communications – in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.\\nBoard and management decision-making processes, and oversight for making the payments described above.\\nFor these purposes, a “grassroots lobbying communication” is one directed to the general public that:\\nRefers to specific legislation or regulation,\\nReflects a view on legislation or regulation, or\\nEncourages the recipient to take action regarding legislation or regulation.\\n“Indirect lobbying” is lobbying conducted by trade associations or other organizations to which Amazon contributes. Both “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts at the local, state, and federal levels.\\nThis report shall be presented to the Audit Committee and posted on Amazon’s website.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nFrom 2015-2018 Amazon spent $48.2 million on federal lobbying, which does not include state lobbying, where Amazon also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or entirely absent. For example, from 2012- 2018 Amazon spent $1.38 million lobbying in California. Amazon’s lobbying “to tamp down ballooning scrutiny and threats of heavy regulation” has generated questionable media attention.1 Amazon also lobbies abroad, in 2018 having spent between €1.75-2.0 million on European lobbying efforts.\\nAmazon fails to disclose belonging to the Business Roundtable (“BRT”), which spent $23.2 million lobbying dollars in 2018. Amazon signed the socially responsible BRT Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation, yet the BRT lobbies to limit the essential ownership right of stockholders to file shareholder proposals like this one. While Amazon does disclose the gross amounts of trade association and 501(c)4 payments, it does not break out payments by group, and fails to disclose the portions of these payments that are used for lobbying.\\nLack of disclosure can present serious reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts Amazon’s public positions. For example, Amazon joined the We Are Still In campaign – launched after President Trump dropped out of the Paris climate agreement – but The New York Times reports2 that Amazon donated $15,000 to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which disputes climate change science. Amazon cofounded The Climate Pledge, announcing a commitment to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early,3 yet is a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent over $1.5 billion lobbying since 1998, working actively to undermine the Paris climate accord.4 Such contradictions between Amazon’s policy and its lobbying efforts can create reputational damage, negatively impact our ability to attract and retain talent, and harm long-term value.\\nTHEREFORE: Please vote FOR an expansion of Amazon's lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",

Wasted food production is responsible for consuming 25 percent of U.S. freshwater, 19 percent of fertilizer, and 18 percent of cropland.\\nProject Drawdown cited food waste reduction as the third most impactful tactic in reducing global GHG emissions.\\nAccording to the U.N.

(Apple or the Company) request that the Board of Directors report annually to shareholders, at reasonable expense and excluding confidential and proprietary information, regarding the Company's policies on freedom of expression and access to information, including whether it has publicly committed to respect freedom of expression as a human right; the oversight mechanisms for formulating and administering policies on freedom of expression and access to information; and a description of the actions Apple has taken in the past year in response to government or other third-party demands that were reasonably likely to limit free expression or access to information.\\nSupporting Statement:SUPPORTING STATEMENTApple sells products and services in countries whose governments limit free expression and punish dissent. The government of China, a market accounting for 20% of Apple's net sales in 2018,1 suppress[es] politically sensitive speech and wrong-oriented online content, according to Human Rights Watch, and blocks sites using a filtering system nicknamed the Great Firewall.2Apple has cooperated with requests made by the government of China to restrict free expression and access to information. In 2017, Apple removed almost all virtual private network (VPN) providers' apps from its Chinese App Store, following a request from the government of China. VPNs have been used by activists and others to circumvent the Great Firewall, leading to a ban on their private use. The U.N.'s special rapporteur on opinion and expression registered concern over Apple's move.3 Such controversies are not likely to be limited to China: Russia and Turkey have also enacted curbs on VPNs, and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently signed legislation giving the government broad powers to punish speech.4Apple removed 634 apps in 2018 for legal violation, 517 of them in China. Apple disclosed that the vast majority relate to illegal gambling or pornography,5 but did not indicate why the others were removed. Apple pulled The New York Times app from the Chinese App Store in 2017 following a request from the government of China. The Times' website had been blocked in China since a series of 2012 stories describing personal wealth amassed by the country's political elite.6The 2019 Corporate Accountability Index by Ranking Digital Rights (RDR) ranked Apple 7th among 12 internet and mobile ecosystem companies. Although RDR gave Apple good marks for privacy, it criticized the Company's governance of freedom of expression issues, including its failure to commit publicly to respect freedom of expression as a human right, and its lack of transparency on policies and practices related to freedom of expression.7 The information requested in this Proposal is intended to close those gaps.

However, our Company has not explicitly linked sustainability goals with senior executive incentives. Investors seek clarity on how Apple drives sustainability improvement and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability. Integrating sustainability into executive compensation assessments would enhance Apple’s approach.\\n\\nMany multi-national companies, including Intel, Alcoa, PepsiCo, and Mead Johnson, have integrated sustainability metrics into their executive pay incentive plans. Another prominent example is Royal Dutch Shell, which announced in December 2018 its plans to tie a portion of executive pay to concrete targets linked to the company’s net carbon footprint.\\n\\nThe increasing incorporation of sustainability metrics into executive pay evaluative criteria stems from the growing recognition that sustainability strategies can drive growth, as well as enhance profitability and shareholder value.\\n\\nThe 2016 Glass Lewis report\\xa0In-Depth: Linking Compensation to Sustainability\\xa0found a “mounting body of research showing that firms that operate in a more responsible manner may perform better financially….

Linking sustainability metrics to executive compensation could reduce risks related to sustainability underperformance, incentivize employees to meet sustainability goals and achieve resultant benefits, and increase accountability. Metrics relevant to our Company could include indicators related to pressing issues such as: environmental impacts and waste, supply chain human rights and risk management, worker health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and data privacy and security.\\n',\n",
       " \"Resolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (Arthur J. Gallagher) adopt a policy for improving board and top management diversity (the Policy) requiring that the initial lists of candidates from which new management-supported director nominees and chief executive officers (CEOs) recruited from outside the company are chosen by the board or relevant committee (each, an Initial List) should include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. The Policy should provide that any third-party consultant asked to furnish an Initial List will be requested to include such candidates.\\nSupporting Statement:Arthur J. Gallagher appears to have no people of color among its directors and CEO.A growing body of empirical research indicates a significant positive relationship between firm value and the percentage of women and minorities in leadership. A 2012 Credit Suisse Research Institute study found that companies with one or more women directors delivered higher average returns on equity, better average growth and higher price/book value multiples.1 A 2015 McKinsey study found that corporate leadership in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their national industry median.2Adopting a policy that requires consideration of women and minority candidates for every open director seat and external CEO search would assist the board in developing a diverse board and executive team. According to a 2016 Harvard Business Review study, including more than one woman or member of a racial minority in a finalist pool helps combat unconscious bias among interviewers and increases the likelihood of a diverse hire.3 We believe that all of our portfolio companies should have a robust diversity search policy in place to institutionalize the board's commitment to achieving and maintaining racial and gender diversity over the long term, including beyond the terms of the incumbent directors and CEO.The proposed rule resembles the Rooney Rule in the National Football League (NFL), which requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations openings and was recently expanded to include general manager jobs and equivalent front office positions. It does not dictate who should be hired, but instead widens the talent pool and requires a diverse set of candidates for consideration. While corporate boards may face differing circumstances, it is difficult to ignore the positive impact of the Rooney Rule on diversity. In the twelve years before the Rule was implemented, the NFL had four minority head coaches and one minority general manager. Twelve years after, the NFL had sixteen minority head coaches and eight minority general managers.4The Policy described in this Proposal would apply to only those CEO searches that consider candidates from outside Arthur J. Gallagher. We do not intend for the Policy to be a substitute for robust internal succession planning, and we encourage Arthur J. Gallagher to maintain and disclose a process for fostering a diverse talent pipeline for executive management.We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Whereas: The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy 1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent that of men. This disparity can equal half a million dollars over a career. Intersecting race, the gap for African American and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women overall will not reach pay equity until 2059, African American women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224.United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay numbers, assessing the pay of men and women, minorities and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but mostly ignore median pay gaps. Regulation in the United Kingdom mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Bank of New York Mellon reported a 20 percent median base pay gap and a 22 percent bonus pay gap for its London branch, but has not published its global median pay gap.Bank of New York Mellon reports women and minorities earn 99 percent the compensation received by men and non-minorities on an equal pay basis. Yet, that statistically adjusted number is only half the story, failing to consider how discrimination affects opportunity. The objective of this proposal - median pay gap disclosure - addresses the structural bias that affects the jobs women and minorities hold, particularly when white men hold most higher paying jobs.Women account for 41 percent of our company's global workforce, but only 25 percent of senior leadership. Mercer finds female executives are 20 to 30 percent more likely to leave financial services careers than other careers. Actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests diverse leadership leads to superior stock performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling. Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.Public policy risk is of concern in the United States. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends before Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request Bank of New York Mellon report on the company's global median gender/racial pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information.The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Resolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire) adopt a policy for improving board and top management diversity (the Policy) requiring that the initial lists of candidates from which new management-supported director nominees and chief executive officers (CEOs) recruited from outside the company are chosen by the board or relevant committee (each, an Initial List) should include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. The Policy should provide that any third-party consultant asked to furnish an Initial List will be requested to include such candidates.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting StatementBerkshire appears to have no people of color among its directors and CEO.A growing body of empirical research indicates a significant positive relationship between firm value and the percentage of women and minorities in leadership. A 2012 Credit Suisse Research Institute study found that companies with one or more women directors delivered higher average returns on equity, better average growth and higher price/book value multiples.1 A 2015 McKinsey study found that corporate leadership in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their national industry median.2Adopting a policy that requires consideration of women and minority candidates for every open director seat and external CEO search would assist the board in developing a diverse board and executive team. According to a 2016 Harvard Business Review study, including more than one woman or member of a racial minority in a finalist pool helps combat unconscious bias among interviewers and increases the likelihood of a diverse hire.3 We believe that all of our portfolio companies should have a robust diversity search policy in place to institutionalize the board's commitment to achieving and maintaining racial and gender diversity over the long term, including beyond the terms of the incumbent directors and CEO.The proposed rule resembles the Rooney Rule in the National Football League (NFL), which requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations openings and was recently expanded to include general manager jobs and equivalent front office positions. It does not dictate who should be hired, but instead widens the talent pool and requires a diverse set of candidates for consideration. While corporate boards may face differing circumstances, it is difficult to ignore the positive impact of the Rooney Rule on diversity. In the twelve years before the Rule was implemented, the NFL had four minority head coaches and one minority general manager. Twelve years after, the NFL had sixteen minority head coaches and eight minority general managers.4The Policy described in this Proposal would apply to only those CEO searches that consider candidates from outside Berkshire. We do not intend for the Policy to be a substitute for robust internal succession planning, and we encourage Berkshire to maintain and disclose a process for fostering a diverse talent pipeline for executive management.\\n\",\n",

This contradiction poses reputational risk for the company with both clients and investors. Moreover, proxy voting practices that ignore climate change seem to ignore significant company-specific and economy-wide risks associated with negative impacts of climate change.\\nWe believe it is BlackRock’s fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change quantitatively impacts and portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate may impact shareholder value, and vote accordingly. Thus we request this review of our 2019 proxy voting record.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareowners request that the Board of Directors initiate a review assessing BlackRock’s 2019 proxy voting record and evaluate the Company’s proxy voting policies and guiding criteria related to climate change, including any recommended future changes.

In his 2018 annual letter to CEOs Larry Fink wrote:\\nStakeholders are demanding that companies exercise leadership on a broader range of issues. And they are right to: a company’s ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrates the leadership and good governance that is so essential to sustainable growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process.\\nExisting governance documents evolved in an environment of shareholder primacy, but the Statement articulates a new purpose, moves away from shareholder primacy, and includes commitment to all stakeholders. The Statement may be beneficial to associate with our brand, however, the Statement, as company policy, may conflict with Delaware law unless integrated into Company governance documents, including bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, and/or Committee Charters.\\nCompany actions should also become integrated with the Statement.

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by Schwab used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. Description of management's and the Board's decision-making process and oversight for making payments described in section 2 above.For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Schwab is a member.Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on Schwab's website.\\nSupporting Statement:We encourage transparency and accountability in Schwab's use of funds to lobby. Schwab spent $24,383,000 from 2010 -2018 on federal lobbying. These figures do not include state lobbying expenditures, where Schwab also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Schwab spent $700,960 on lobbying in California from 2010-2018. Schwab's lobbying on the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act has drawn scrutiny.1Schwab serves on the board of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA, which has spent $58,730,000 on lobbying from 2010-2018. And Schwab previously served on the board of the Chamber of Commerce,2 which has spent over $1.5 billion on lobbying since 1998. Schwab does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying.We are concerned that Schwab's lack of lobbying and trade association disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, Schwab supports protecting the interests of investors by holding the financial industry to a high standard, yet Schwab, SIFMA and the Chamber reportedly lobbied to quash various aspects of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule to require investment advisers to put their clients' interests ahead of their own.3We believe the reputational damage stemming from this misalignment between general policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by Schwab. Thus, we urge Schwab expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",
       " \"RESOLVED: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt and enforce a policy requiring The Charles Schwab Corporation (the Company) to disclose annually its EEO-1 data - a comprehensive breakdown of its workforce by race and gender according to 10 employment categories - on its website or in its corporate responsibility report, beginning in 2020. We encourage the company to also release its workforce pay data, broken down by race and gender, which it now provides to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\nSupporting Statement:Stockholder Supporting StatementDiversity matters. Numerous studies suggest that companies with comprehensive diversity policies and programs, and strong leadership commitment to implement and fully integrate diversity into their culture and practices, enhance long-term shareholder value. A McKinsey & Company global study (Diversity Matters, February 2015), for example, found that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry median.Workplace diversity provides competitive advantage by generating diverse, valuable perspectives, creativity, innovation and adaptation, increased productivity and morale, while eliminating the limitations of groupthink. It also reduces potential legal and reputational risks associated with workplace discrimination and builds corporate reputations as fair employers.The financial services industry, of which the company is a part, is characterized by persistent and pervasive underrepresentation of minorities and women, particularly in senior positions. Government Accountability Office report on the industry shows that while there has been some improvement, the numbers are still low, and vary among groups. Overall minority representation in senior management increased slightly from only 11% in 2007 to 12% in 2017 but for African-American, the numbers decreased and remained unchanged for women (https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688235.pdf).Charles Schwab discloses little or no workforce diversity data or even information about its diversity policies and initiatives. It discusses awards and gives anecdotal stories. These do not allow investors to fully evaluate the company's diversity initiatives and their impact, especially across job categories and particularly in more senior roles. Without more detailed quantitative information on a comparable basis, shareholders have no way to evaluate and benchmark the effectiveness of these efforts over time and relative to peers.Federal law requires companies with 100 or more employees to annually submit an EEO-1 Report to the EEOC. The report profiles a company's workforce by race and gender in 10 job categories, including senior management.Over two-thirds of S&P 100 companies now disclose EEO-1 data, including financial peers such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley; and Intel Corporation will publicly release its employee pay data by race and gender. The proposal received 39.6% support at Schwab last year.The proposal does not limit the company from providing more detailed quantitative and qualitative disclosures where appropriate. We also encourage the company to describe the steps it is taking and the challenges it faces in moving forward to achieve its diversity plans and goals.\\n\",\n",

The Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards may also provide useful assistance.\\nSASB identifies Charter’s material ESG issues as environmental footprint of operations; data privacy; data security; product end-of-life management; managing systemic risks from technology disruptions; and competitive behavior and open internet. Presently, Charter provides insufficient disclosure on these issues. For instance, Charter does not disclose energy use or GHG data to the public. The magnitude of energy use and the source of energy will become increasing material for Charter as the global regulatory focus on climate change increases, including policy incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the prospect of a price on carbon emissions. The absence of this information challenges investors’ ability to comprehensively evaluate Charter’s management of ESG risks and opportunities.\\nInvestors are increasingly calling for improved corporate disclosure of performance on material ESG issues:\\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment: 2,300 signatories that represent $86.3 trillion in assets who commit to: “seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which [they] invest.”\\nSASB Investor Advisory Group: 46 global asset owners and asset managers (including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors), who hold over 20% of shares in Charter, and seek consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure of material, decision-useful sustainability-related information from corporate issuers.\\nCDP, representing 525 institutional investors globally with approximately $96 trillion in assets, calls for company disclosure on GHG emissions and climate change management programs. 70% of the S&P 500 disclose to CDP.\\nThe Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), commissioned by the Financial Stability Board and supported by a cross section of influential investors and business leaders, recommends companies adopt targets to manage climate-related risks and disclose related strategies.\\nIn 2018, the Governance & Accountability Institute found that 86% of S&P 500 companies published sustainability reports. Substantive reporting allows companies to better integrate and capture value from existing sustainability efforts, identify gaps and opportunities in policies and practices, enhance company-wide communications, and recruit and retain employees. By not reporting, Charter is falling\\nbehind its peers, including Verizon Communications and Liberty Global, who provide comprehensive ESG reports that include GHG reduction goals.\\nIn conclusion, we believe a sustainability report would provide shareholders with needed insight into the Company’s policies and practices on potentially material environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities.\\n',\n",

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem), owned jointly by Chevron and Phillips 66, is a major petrochemical producer in the Gulf Coast.\\nPetrochemical facilities like ethane crackers and polyethylene processing plants produce dangerous pollutants including benzene (a known carcinogen), Volatile Organic Compounds, and sulfur dioxide. These operations can become inundated and pose significant chemical release risks during extreme weather events. Flooding from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 resulted in CPChem plant shut downs and the release of unpermitted, unsafe levels of pollutants. Nearby Houston residents reported respiratory and other health problems following CPChem’s releases during Hurricane Harvey.\\nGrowing storms and the costs they bring our company are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as global warming escalates. Recent reports show that greenhouse gas emissions throughout the petrochemical and plastic supply chain contribute significantly to climate change, thereby exacerbating the threat of physical risks such as storms. Flood-related damage is projected to be highest in Texas, where many of CPChem’s petrochemical plants are concentrated, and Houston alone has seen three 500-year floods in a three-year span. Chevron stated that Hurricane Harvey is the primary reason for lower earnings of $70 million from CPChem in 2017.\\nCivil society groups have mobilized to oppose the expansion of petrochemical facilities in their communities due to concerns regarding direct health and livelihood impacts from air and water pollutant releases. Such opposition threatens to jeopardize CPChem’s social license to operate in the region. Historically, releases from CPChem’s petrochemical operations have exceeded legal limits, exposing the company to liability. As climate change intensifies flooding and storm strength, the potential for unplanned chemical releases grows.\\nIn spite of these risks, CPChem has accelerated its petrochemical activity in the Gulf Coast, investing heavily to expand in flood-prone areas of Texas. The company has generally disclosed that physical climate-related risks may impact its business and that it has a risk management system to plan for resiliency. The impacts to CPChem’s operations from Hurricane Harvey, however, indicate the company’s level of preparedness is insufficient.

Committee charter language can help to define the scope of fiduciary duties of committee members and ensure that effective systems are in place.A failure to adequately plan for a low carbon transition, including climate change policy, competition from renewables, peak oil demand, and unburnable fossil fuel reserves, may place investor capital at substantial risk. Implementing the Proposal would represent a prudent path forward by formalizing board level oversight of climate change strategy so the company may remain successful in an increasingly decarbonizing economy.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors charter a new Board Committee on Climate Risk to evaluate the board and management's climate strategy and to better inform board decision making on climate risks and opportunities. The charter should explicitly require the committee to report to the full board on corporate strategy,above and beyond matters of legal compliance, assessing the company's responses to climate related risks and opportunities, including the potential impacts of climate change on business, strategy, financial planning, and our company's operating environment.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: While the ultimate responsibility for climate strategy should fall on the full board, a board committee can conduct a more focused review than the full board, and therefore better inform and strengthen board decision making by: Preparing reports to the board with depth and attention to existential climate risks; Making recommendations to the board regarding corporate planning time frames, carbon reduction goals, and capital allocation strategies to redirect its business model and financial flows consistent with the Paris Agreement; Providing leadership for the full board's climate deliberations; Coordinating with audit and compensation committees to ensure integrated attention to climate risk; Delineating responsibility and evaluating the efficacy of management and board responses to climate risks and opportunities.A formal board committee charter clarifies a fiduciary duty of care on climate change matters. The board should consider the need for staffing to adequately resource the committee.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Whereas, Chevron is the second-largest integrated energy company in the United States. Chevron's global operations have contributed to negative impacts on human rights, community relations, health, air quality, and water, all of which are identified as material for the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production sector by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. Its operations may have discriminatory impact, with disparate harm on communities of color and fenceline communities. Emissions from the use of Chevron's products and operations contribute to the climate crisis, which may compound impacts to already burdened communities.1Discharge or leaks from Chevron's operations may impact human health and the environment, and affected communities may not be adequately consulted or informed of risks.2 For example, spills from a Chevron well in California seeped over 900,000 gallons of crude oil and water in 2019, generating a $2.7 million fine for failure to operate with good practice and harm to human health and the environment.3 Fenceline communities adjacent to Chevron's Richmond, CA refinery have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and asthma. Like most environmental justice communities burdened with the cumulative impacts of pollution, 15% of residents in Richmond are living in poverty and 80% are people of color.4 Impacts on communities may also result in litigation, project delays, and costly fines. An Ecuadorian court issued a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron for its legacy Texaco operations in Ecuador, which historically disposed of billions of gallons of toxic waste into waterways, impacting over 30,000 indigenous peoples. Chevron faced a $160 million settlement and is required to take nationwide safety and chemical accident prevention measures following repeated violations of the Clean Air Act from chemical releases, deadly explosions, and fires.5 The city of Richmond filed a lawsuit against Chevron for health impacts, economic losses, and environmental harm, citing its lapses in maintenance and disregard for public safety.6While Chevron has a Human Rights Policy and Operational Excellence Management System, investors are unable to assess the effectiveness of these systems in identifying risks, ensuring meaningful stakeholder engagement, reducing negative impacts on communities and the environment, and provision of remedy. In the 2019 Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, Chevron received zero points on remedy, evaluating effectiveness of human rights actions, and communicating how impacts are addressed.The pattern and number of penalties, court filings, and protests Chevron faces from fenceline communities raise questions about whether Chevron's policies and systems are effectively implemented to prevent, mitigate and remedy human rights impacts.\\nResolved:\\xa0: Shareholders request the Board of Directors commission an independent third-party report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, evaluating the effectiveness of Chevron's efforts to prevent, mitigate and remedy actual and potential human rights impacts of its operations.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: This Report might include: The extent and nature of community consultation to inform its analysis; and Assessment of impacts on environmental justice communities.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that global warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius will create catastrophic impacts. Specifically, it instructs that global emissions of carbon dioxide must reach \"net zero\" by 2050. If warming is kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius versus 2 degrees, studies point to estimated savings of $20 trillion to the global economy by 2100.\\nThe energy industry is one of the largest contributors to climate change and Chevron is the\\xa0second largest global emitter\\xa0in the sector. Chevron’s investment choices matter. Every dollar invested in fossil fuel resources increases risk to the economy and investor portfolios.\\nInvestors recognize this growing risk. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund announced divestment from oil and gas exploration and production companies. The European Investment Bank and the World Bank announced they will cease funding fossil fuel projects. Other investors are seeking\\xa0Paris Alignment from large emitters. Criteria for alignment include: disclosure of Scope 1 through 3 emissions; adoption of a net zero by 2050 or equivalent target; a business plan for becoming Paris Aligned; and a declining carbon footprint.\\nPeer oil and gas companies are taking steps toward alignment with Paris goals. Shell announced Scope 3 greenhouse gas intensity reduction ambitions and has decreased reserves life\\xa0below the industry standard. Total has invested substantially in renewable energy and storage. Equinor is diversifying into renewables. Orsted, previously an oil and gas company, sold its fossil fuel portfolio. Repsol announced a\\xa0net zero by 2050\\xa0target and will write down billions in unaligned assets.\\nIn contrast, while acknowledging the climate problem, Chevron’s greenhouse gas reduction goals are short term and do not address Scope 3 product emissions. Its greenhouse gas reduction measures address only operational emissions (accounting for less than 13 percent of its total emissions). The\\nCompany’s\\xa0investments in alternative technologies\\xa0are dramatically outweighed by its\\xa0fossil fuel investments\\xa0($200 million v. $20 billion, respectively). A recent\\xa0Carbon Tracker\\xa0analysis finds that 35 percent of Chevron’s production to 2040 is outside Paris’ below-2 degree objective.

       " \"Resolved:\\xa0The shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (Chipotle) urge the Board of Directors to report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential and proprietary information, on the use of contractual provisions requiring employees of Chipotle to arbitrate employment-related claims. The report should specify the proportion of the workforce subject to such provisions; the number of employment-related arbitration claims initiated and decided in favor of the employee, in each case in the previous calendar year; and any changes in policy or practice Chipotle has made, or intends to make, as a result of California's ban on agreeing to arbitration as a condition of employment.\\nSupporting Statement:In recent years, public attention has focused on the use by companies of agreements requiring employees to pursue employment-related claims, including sexual harassment claims, through arbitration. High-profile sexual harassment cases involving Fox News, Google and Uber highlighted the impact of these agreements. A robust public debate has ensued, including responses by legislators, regulators and state attorneys general.Mandatory arbitration precludes employees from suing in court for wrongs like wage theft, discrimination and harassment, and requires them to submit to private arbitration, which has been found to favor companies and discourage claims. Sexual harassment is an urgent concern inthe fast food industry - a 2016 study found that 40% of female fast-food employees had been sexually harassed-and press reports indicate that sexual harassment and assault claims have been brought against Yum chains Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. Wage theft from low-wage employees is widespread; a study estimated that wage theft costs low-wage workers in three large U.S. cities $3 billion per year.1A bill to end mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2019, and 56 state and territorial attorneys general voiced support for it. A 2019 article characterized the movement to end forced arbitration as having swept Silicon Valley/' with employee walk-outs and company policy changes.2 California recently banned the practice of requiring arbitration agreements as a condition of employment and Washington State enacted a law in 2018 invalidating contracts requiring arbitration of sexual harassment or assault claims.Finally, because arbitration is private and contractual, arbitrating employment-related claims can allow a toxic culture to flourish, increasing the severity of eventual consequences and harming employee morale. Confidentiality provisions can prevent an employee's lawyer from using knowledge of wrongdoing to identify other victims.The information sought in this Proposal would allow shareholders to assess the risks posed by the use of mandatory arbitration of employment-related claims.We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal\\n\",\n",
       " 'In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) amplified the urgency behind the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement cautioning it will be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, rather than two degrees Celsius, to minimize the worst impacts of climate change. Achieving this will require deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions in all sectors.\\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment found “climate change presents numerous challenges to sustaining and enhancing crop productivity, livestock health, and the economic vitality of rural communities,” and rising temperatures are “the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of U.S. agriculture.” According to a 2015 report by Citigroup, the costs of failing to address climate change could lead to a $72 trillion loss to global GDP.\\nUnfortunately, UNEP reported that global emissions reached record levels in 2018 and continue to rise, increasing the risk of disruption to agricultural systems.\\nChipotle acknowledges the materiality of climate change, stating: “We know that climate change and extreme weather may affect key crops and how our suppliers operate.” Chipotle also states climate change may lead to price spikes for key ingredients and that this would have particularly adverse effects on operating results.\\nChipotle’s efforts to support sustainable agriculture and its commitment to measure its full carbon footprint by 2025 are sound first steps, but lag the scale, pace, and rigor of the approach established by McDonald’s, YUM! Brands, Hyatt Hotels, Walmart, Tyson Foods, PepsiCo, Nestle, Mars, Kellogg, General Mills, and Danone. These companies have already set, or committed to set, long-term GHG management goals to reduce their full value chain emissions in-line with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2018 IPCC report. Proponents believe this is a prudent course of action that will help reduce risks associated with climate change.\\nGiven the impact of climate change on the economy, the environment, and agricultural systems, and the short amount of time in which to address it, proponents believe Chipotle has a clear responsibility to its investors and stakeholders to develop its own strategies to align the emissions from its value chain with the projected long-term constraints posed by climate change.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board of Directors of Chipotle Mexican Grill publish a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing if, and how, it plans to reduce its total contribution to climate change and align its operations with the projected long-term constraints posed by climate change as set forth in the Paris Climate Agreement and 2018 IPCC Report.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn the report, shareholders seek information, among other issues at board and management discretion, on if, and how, the Company can undertake the following actions:\\nAdopting overall long-term GHG emissions reduction targets for the Company’s full carbon footprint;\\nIncreasing the scale, pace, and rigor of initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of Chipotle’s supply chain.\\n',\n",
       " \"WHEREAS: The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of their male counterparts. The gap for African America and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059. Mercer finds actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation. Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests more gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling. Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps. Regulatory risks associated with pay equity exist. The Paycheck Fairness Act, pending in Congress, would improve company-level transparency and strengthen penalties for equal pay violations. California, Massachusetts, New York and Maryland have enacted significant changes to their equal pay laws. Since 2018 the United Kingdom has required large businesses to provide annual gender pay gap reports. The Cigna U.K. 2019 Gender Pay Gap Report shows a 25 percent gender pay gap (up from 22 percent in 2018) and a 34 percent gender bonus pay gap between male and female employees. Women comprised 56 percent of total employees but held only 37 percent of senior positions. Cigna does not report on the gender pay gap for its U.S. employees. Last year Cigna shareholders voted 35.63 percent in favor of a similar Gender Pay Gap resolution. Shareholder support represented more than $17.3 billion at the date of the 2019 annual meeting. Cigna has shown no meaningful progress on this issue. Leading large-cap companies across industry sectors including Apple, Starbucks and Bank of New York Mellon, among others, have publicly committed to pay equity and published the results of gender pay assessments. Equal pay and equal opportunity, particularly at the management level, are linked to better financial performance and more robust decision-making. Companies would be well served by understanding the equity attributes of their pay, at all levels of the corporation, by gender as well as other facets of diversity, such as race and ethnicity. Amid increasing regulatory and investor interest, it is apparent that companies should understand, manage, and report on pay equity to shareholders.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED: Shareholders request Cigna report on the company's global mean and median gender pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage mean and median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation.\\n\",\n",

Citigroup is a member of trade associations that lobby for policies that directly contradict the company’s public positions on critical issues like climate change. Despite reputational risks, Citigroup fails to disclose its trade association payments and the portions of those payments used for lobbying.\\xa0\\nCitigroup spent more than $50 million on federal lobbying over the last ten years. This figure excludes Citigroup’s lobbying: (1) in the 42 states where Citigroup lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent; and (2) in Europe, which totaled €700,000 – €799,000 in 2018. Citigroup belongs to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent more than $1.5 billion on lobbying since 1998. Citigroup does not disclose how much it contributes to the Chamber or what portion of the company’s contributions the Chamber uses for lobbying.\\xa0\\nExamples of policy contradictions that present clear reputational risks include:\\xa0\\n• Citigroup supported the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Chamber has worked tirelessly to undermine the Paris Agreement.\\xa0\\n• Citigroup has limited its investments in coal since 2015. The Chamber pushed to expand coal mining on federal lands in its 2017 platform. Citigroup claims to use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for sustainability reporting, which require Citigroup to report “any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions” (GRI Standard 415). Citigroup, however, fails to report the glaring contradictions between its stated positions on climate and the lobbying activities it funds, further demonstrating that Citigroup’s disclosures are inadequate.\\xa0\\nWe believe the reputational damage stemming from Citigroup’s direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value, and we urge the Board to immediately institute comprehensive lobbying disclosure.\\xa0\\n',\n",

       " \"WHEREAS: Comcast and its subsidiaries are under intense public scrutiny for an alleged failure to protect employees from sexual harassment in the workplace, failing to hold those culpable accountable, and lacking transparency.In 2017, NBC attracted global attention when it fired Today host Matt Lauer for ongoing sexual harassment of employees. In October 2019, Ronan Farrow alleged that NBC covered up accusations against Lauer.Controversy has focused on NBC's insistence on conducting an internal investigation led by management, rather than independent advisors. Six presidential candidates have called on the Democratic National Committee to demand Comcast conduct an independent investigation into its toxic culture.NBC News' digital editorial staff have voted to form a union, with the NewsGuild of New York, noting serious questions about how NBC News has handled workplace sexual misconduct and its opaque procedures for exposing powerful predators.This failure to provide a safe workplace extends to Comcast call centers, where employees have described a hostile culture of sexual harassment. In July 2018, Comcast fired three call center employees who filed complaints. One has now filed a complaint at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).Throughout the economy, fear of retaliation in reporting harassment is a particular concern. An EEOC study of harassment in the workplace found that 75 percent of employees who reported some sort of harassment experienced retaliation and that 87 to 94 percent of harassment victims did not file a formal complaint.Workplace harassment can harm shareholder value. The market capitalization of Wynn Resorts dropped by 3 billion dollars over two days following harassment allegations against CEO Steve Wynn. 21st Century Fox agreed to a 90 million dollar settlement with shareholders who alleged that directors failed to hold accountable senior executives who perpetuated sexual harassment.Comcast and its subsidiaries rely on consumers to trust their brands. A recent Harvard Business Review study found that a single sexual harassment claim can make a company seem less equitable and more problematic than financial misconduct or fraud and would be enough to dramatically shape public perception of a company and elicit perceptions of structural unfairness.To avoid legal and reputational risk, as the employer of 184,000 workers, Comcast must create a culture of accountability and transparency, and protect employees from harassment and discrimination.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED: Shareholders urge the Board of Directors to conduct an independent investigation into and prepare a report (at reasonable expense, omitting confidential and proprietary information) on risks posed by the Company's failures to prevent workplace sexual harassment.\\nSupporting Statement:SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Proponents suggest that the report assess steps Comcast could take to do a better job of holding employees who cause harm accountable, such as integrating metrics on creating a sexual harassment-free workplace into the performance measures of the CEO and senior leadership.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Banks play a critical role in meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The Bank of England notes the global financial system supports carbon-producing projects that will cause global temperature to rise over 4 degrees Celsius – more than double the limit necessary to avoid catastrophic warming.\\nThe 2018 Intergovernmental Panel report on climate warns that global warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius will create devastating impacts including loss of life, infrastructure damage, supply chain dislocations, lost production, and water and energy disruptions. If warming is kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius versus 2 degrees, studies indicate a potential savings of $20 trillion to the global economy by 2100. Just 215 of the biggest global companies reported almost $1 trillion at risk from climate impacts, some within five years.\\nEstimates indicate the value of risk under business-as-usual scenarios may be equivalent to a permanent reduction of 5 to 20 percent in portfolio value in just over a decade. There are increasing state and local regulations for energy projects, increased barriers to high carbon projects, and shifting market expectations related to future energy needs. A recent Carbon Tracker report estimates that almost a third ($2.3 trillion USD) of potential capex to 2025 for oil and gas companies should not be deployed under the International Energy Agency’s World Outlook 2016 450 scenario (a proxy for well below 2-degree Celsius scenario). Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. also stands to benefit from contributing to the funding required for a successful low carbon transition by seeking out green opportunities across all business functions. An estimated $90 trillion of investment is required by 2030 to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. The financial sector has a key role in enabling the transition to a low-carbon future, including small and mid-cap banks.\\nWhile Community Trust Bancorp acknowledges business might be “adversely impacted to the extent that weather-related events cause damage or disruption to properties or businesses,” it also states climate change initiatives will adversely impact business. The company has seen the impacts of the declining coal industry in its market area and has had to diversify its portfolio.

This climate strategy resolution reflects our belief that we need strategies for all emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) across the whole energy sector.\\n\\nEmissions reductions\\n\\nThe goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, to aim for a global net-zero-emission energy system, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.\\n\\nTo reach that goal, the IPCC special report Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018) indicates that absolute net energy-related emissions should be reduced by approximately 70% (2°C) * to 100% (1.5°C) by 2050 relative to 2016.\\n\\nWith an expected growth of energy demand of around 40%, the net carbon intensity of energy products (CO2 per unit of energy) should be reduced by approximately 80% (2°C) to 100% (1.5°C) by 2050.\\n\\n* median of the IPCC Lower-2°C pathway group\\n\\nWe believe the company could thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to execute a Paris-aligned strategy, allowing the company to meet increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels compatible with the global intergovernmental consensus of the Paris Climate Agreement.\\n\\nYou have our support.\\n',\n",
       " 'Plastic pollution has become a critical and urgent global problem. Experts estimate 300,000 metric tonnes of plastic are polluted to the ocean from U.S. land sources every year. The global figure is eight to twelve million tonnes and is projected to increase rapidly. The environmental impacts of plastic pollution are vast, including significant harm to marine and terrestrial ecosystems and wildlife. Plastic waste breaks down and persists in the environment, eventually accumulating in agricultural soils, water supplies, food supplies, and the human body – with as yet unknown health repercussions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEPA data shows only 8.4 percent of plastic waste generated in the U.S. was recycled in 2017; 76 percent was sent to landfill. Single-use plastic packaging is the largest source of this plastic waste.\\xa0\\n139 companies, including Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, Coca-Cola, WalMart, Target, and Colgate-Palmolive have committed to eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging and ensure the remainder is reusable, recyclable, or compostable in practice by 2025. In addition, Unilever and Procter & Gamble have committed to cut their use of virgin plastic in half by 2025 and 2030, respectively.\\xa0\\nCVS Health (CVS) has identified packaging as a material issue and “Sustainable Products and Packaging” is a key component of CVS’s CSR strategy. However, CVS has not disclosed the amount or types of plastic used in its packaging; whether its packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable in practice; or if it intends to incorporate recycled content into its plastic packaging. Such information is important as CVS Health offers more than 2,500 private label products (according to its website), ranging from medicines to beauty products to snacks and beverages. Many have a high reliance on plastic packaging, likely contributing to plastic pollution problems.\\xa0\\nIn its 2018 CSR report, CVS states it will be “developing our criteria for CVS Pharmacy brand printed packaging to create more sustainable packaging for our products.” This sounds like a promising first step, but given CVS’s mission to “leverage our scale, expertise and innovative spirit in ways that positively impact all of our stakeholders,” proponents believe CVS should ramp up its efforts to reduce the harmful environmental impacts of its plastic packaging and help improve plastic recycling rates above 8.4 percent.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request CVS Health Corporation issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, discussing if, and how, it can further reduce its environmental impacts by increasing the scale and pace of its sustainable plastic packaging initiatives.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn the report, shareholders seek information on (among other issues at board and management discretion):\\nCurrent plastic usage levels by type, the percentage of plastic packaging that is recyclable in practice, and the percentage that contains post-consumer recycled content;\\nAny initiatives CVS has implemented or explored to increase the use of post-consumer recycled content or pursue alternative packaging materials;\\nHow CVS works with policymakers to support recycling infrastructure and legislation, both directly and via trade associations.\\n',\n",

       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year (at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information) describing if, and how, Delta Air Lines’ lobbying activities (direct and through trade associations) align with the goal of limiting average global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal). The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent annual “Emissions Gap Report” issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (November 26, 2019), critical gaps remain between the commitments national governments have made and the actions required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policy-makers to close these gaps.\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational and legal risks to investors. These efforts also present systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, pose a systemic risk to economic stability and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks, and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but, unfortunately, too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C— as an imperative. We are convinced that unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of their portfolios. We see future “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater as both unacceptable and uninvestable.\\nWe commend Delta Air Lines for responding to CDP’s annual climate change survey, including information on the company’s direct (in the company’s name) and indirect (through trade associations and other organizations) lobbying efforts related to climate change and their consistency with corporate policy. Two hundred institutional investors managing $6.5 trillion recently wrote to Delta, seeking an answer to a different question: How does Delta work to ensure that its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with the Paris Agreement’s goals, and what does the company do to address any misalignments it has found? The investors received no response to their letter.\\nThus, we urge the Board and management to assess the company’s climate related lobbying and report to shareholders.\\n',\n",
       " \"RESOLVED that shareholders of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) urge the Board of Directors to strengthen Delta's prevention of workplace sexual harassment by formalizing the Board's oversight responsibility, aligning senior executive compensation incentives, reviewing (and if necessary overseeing revision of) company policies, and reporting to shareholders by December 31, 2020 on actions taken (omitting confidential and proprietary information, as well as facts relevant to claims against Delta of which Delta has notice).\\nSupporting Statement:Recently, workplace sexual harassment has generated a great deal of attention from the media and policy makers and has spurred significant public debate. The high-profile #metoo social media hashtag, and sexual harassment claims involving public figures like Bill O'Reilly, Steve Wynn, Les Moonves and Travis Kalanick, have highlighted the prevalence of harassment and its impact. The proportion of Americans who believe that sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious problem increased from 47% in 2011 to 64% in 2017. (Cornerstone)New York and Maryland have passed new laws that, among other things, bar mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims. One hundred twenty-five laws were introduced in 2018 in 32 legislatures on the subject of sexual harassment in the legislature itself.Workplace sexual harassment can damage companies in several ways. First, it may harm corporate reputation, which can alienate consumers. A recent study reported in the Harvard Business Review found that a single sexual harassment claim makes a company seem less equitable and that sexual harassment, more than financial misconduct, is perceived as evidence of a problematic corporate culture.Companies whose corporate culture tolerates sexual harassment tend to have higher turnover and less productive employees. The Center for American Progress estimates median turnover costs at 21% of an employee's annual salary. Productivity can fall due to absenteeism, lower motivation, greater conflict and avoiding interaction with harassers. Allegations of sexual harassment can also lead to declines in share value. For example, the market capitalization of Wynn Resorts dropped by $3 billion over two days after allegations of sexual harassment against CEO Steve Wynn surfaced.A company's board can play a key role in preventing and remedying sexual harassment by setting the appropriate tone-at-the-top. Robust board oversight is especially important for the airline industry. According to one survey, nearly 70% of flight attendants have been sexually harassed while at work. Delta's in-flight service group constitutes 25.2% of its workforce, Delta's second largest operational division.Neither the corporate governance guidelines nor any committee charter assigns responsibility for managing and mitigating of risks related to sexual harassment. While Delta's incentive plan metrics influence payouts related to front-line employees under the company's profit sharing plans, the metrics used for incentive compensation do not include evaluations of ethical behavior or contributions to corporate culture. Delta's 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report makes no reference to sexual harassment, despite highlighting Delta's workplace safety record and the importance of Delta's people-focused culture. We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.\\n\",\n",

Already, the sector is undergoing a rapid transition by moving away from coal, but growing reliance on natural gas creates ongoing risk. Natural gas is a major contributor to climate change due to combustion emissions and methane leaks.2 In 2018, gas contributed to an increase in power sector emissions,3 jeopardizing chances of achieving reductions in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\xa0\\nBuilding new gas infrastructure may be uneconomic and result in costly stranded assets comparable to early retirements now occurring for coal.4 While some low-carbon scenarios show gas use continuing, they rely on carbon removal technologies -- a risky assumption given the technology has not proven economic at scale.5\\xa0\\nDemand response, energy efficiency, renewables plus storage, and electrification are all increasingly cost-effective means of serving energy needs while reducing fossil fuel use and climate impacts.6 City governments, recognizing gas’ climate impacts, are setting policies prohibiting gas hookups for new buildings in favor of safer, healthier electric buildings.7 Furthermore, states, cities, and large consumers continue to set ambitious renewable energy targets, which utilities will need to supply or risk losing business.8 Large tech companies recently banded together to express concern regarding Dominion’s proposed gas heavy plan.9\\xa0\\nWhile Dominion is to be commended for taking climate conscious steps, including setting a long term greenhouse gas target10 and actions to decrease methane leakage,11 investors lack sufficient information to understand if or how the Company can reconcile its growing reliance on natural gas with achieving Virginia’s 100% carbon-free by 2050 target12 or aligning with Paris goals.\\xa0\\nThe Company\\'s disclosures indicate Dominion is continuing to build out expensive gas infrastructure13,14 but is not sufficiently addressing how those costly assets and their depreciation timelines reconcile with climate stability goals or the existence of increasingly low cost, clean energy pathways.\\xa0\\nPeer utilities, including NextEra15 and Xcel,16 have demonstrated alternatives to investing in new gas infrastructure by replacing coal assets with renewables and storage, creating win-win solutions.

According to proxy advisor Glass Lewis “shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the Company and set a pro-shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a CEO or other executive also serves as chairman.”\\n\\nWhile separating the roles of Chair and CEO is the norm in Europe, 53% of S&P 500 boards have also implemented this leading practice. Directors on boards with a joint CEO-Chair report being more likely to have difficulty voicing a dissenting view (57% versus 41%) and to believe that one or more of their fellow directors should be replaced (61% versus 47%) according to a 2019 survey by PwC.\\xa0\\n\\nExcept for a brief transition period, Dominion’s Board has been chaired by current or former Dominion CEOs since 1992. Dominion’s lack of independent board leadership may be aggravated by the fact that John Harris, Dominion’s lead director and Chair of the Board’s Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee, has served on the Board for over twenty years. According to ISS Governance QualityScore, “an excessive tenure is considered to potentially compromise a director’s independence.” CalPERS’ Governance and Sustainability Principles state that independence “can be compromised at 12 years of service.”\\n\\nWe believe independent Board leadership would be particularly useful to oversee the strategic transformation necessary for Dominion to capitalize on the opportunities available in the transition to a low carbon economy.\\xa0Unlike its peers Xcel Energy, Duke Energy, DTE and NRG, Dominion has failed to set a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\\xa0We believe that a board chair independent of management would be better able to lead the process of setting a strategy to position Dominion to take advantage of increased demand for decarbonized electricity and more effectively evaluate and mitigate the risks that excessive investment in natural gas infrastructure could become a stranded asset.[1]\\xa0\\n\\nWe urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.\\n',\n",

Coal burning results in coal waste -also called coal ash- which is laced with heavy metals such as arsenic, and which can contaminate nearby water sources and raise cancer risk with long term exposure. Duke Energy has had three high profile coal ash spills since 2014 at its Sutton, Dan River, and H.F. Lee coal plants, incurring brand damage, environmental and water impacts, and millions of dollars in clean-up costs. In 2018, Hurricane Florence resulted in breaches at two of Duke’s ponds, highlighting Duke’s lack of preparation for storms and flooding whose frequency and intensity are increasing due to climate change. Duke’s response provoked strong public criticism, while peers demonstrated that available best practices could have prevented spills. A 2019 report from the Environmental Integrity Project ranked Duke’s coal ash storage site at the Allen Steam Station as the second-most contaminated site in the nation, with levels of cobalt -- a heavy metal linked to thyroid damage – found in nearby groundwater at 500 times safe levels.\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Harm to vulnerable communities. An NAACP report found people living near coal plants are disproportionately poor and minorities: the six million people living within three miles of U.S. coal plants have an average per capita income of $18,400 per year and 39 percent are people of color.\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Declining air quality. Burning coal results in sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, mercury, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause serious health problems such as respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung diseases; heart attacks; reduced life expectancy; and increased infant mortality.\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Climate change. Coal burning releases carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change. Climate change results in many health harms and challenges ranging from extreme temperatures to declining air and water quality to the spread of warm weather pests and diseases to new areas. In addition to the health impacts, climate change intensifies extreme storms and flooding, threatening the reliability and safety of coal ash infrastructure and increasing the risk of water contamination.\\n\\nDespite all this, Duke has yet to adequately address the risks of its continued use of coal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Duke Energy publish a report assessing how it will mitigate the public health risks associated with Duke’s coal operations in light of increasing vulnerability to climate change impacts such as flooding and severe storms.

       " 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report finding that \"rapid, far-reaching” changes are necessary in the next 10 years to avoid disastrous levels of global warming.[1]\\nThe energy sector has a critical role to play in mitigating climate risks. Already, the sector is undergoing a comprehensive and rapid transition by moving away from coal, but growing reliance on natural gas creates ongoing risk. Natural gas is a major contributor to climate change due to combustion emissions and methane leaks.[2]\\xa0In 2018, gas contributed to an\\xa0increase\\xa0in power sector emissions,[3]\\xa0jeopardizing chances of achieving reductions in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which requires reaching net zero emissions globally by 2050.\\nBuilding new gas infrastructure may be uneconomic and result in costly stranded assets comparable to early retirements now occurring for coal.[4],[5]\\xa0While some low-carbon scenarios show gas use continuing, they rely on significant carbon removal technologies -- a risky assumption given the technology has not proven economic at scale.[6]\\nExisting alternatives to gas -- such as renewables plus storage, demand response, electrification, and energy efficiency -- are all increasingly cost-effective means of serving energy needs while reducing fossil fuel use and climate impacts.[7]\\xa0City governments, recognizing gas’ climate impacts, are setting policies prohibiting gas hookups for new buildings in favor of safer, healthier electric buildings.[8]\\xa0Furthermore, states, cities, and large consumers are setting ambitious renewable energy targets, which utilities will need to supply or risk losing business.[9]\\nWhile Duke is to be commended for setting a long-term climate goal, investors lack sufficient information to understand if or how the Company is addressing the growing risks of reliance on natural gas. The Company\\'s disclosures indicate Duke is continuing to build out expensive gas infrastructure but is not sufficiently addressing how those costly assets reconcile with its decarbonization goals or the existence of increasingly low cost, clean energy pathways.[10]\\nPeer utilities, including NextEra[1]\\xa0and Xcel,[2]\\xa0have demonstrated alternatives to investing in new gas infrastructure by replacing coal assets with renewables and storage, creating win-win solutions. Shareholders are concerned that Duke Energy is lagging behind on such opportunities and increasing its exposure to climate-related risks by investing in significant gas holdings that may become stranded.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Duke issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing how it is responding to the risk of stranded assets of planned natural gas-based infrastructure and assets, as the global response to climate change intensifies.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nWhile the company has the discretion to determine the precise content of the report, meaningful disclosures would allow investors to assess:\\nHow proposed gas infrastructure and depreciation timelines reconcile with achieving Duke’s mid to long-term climate goals.\\n',\n",

This does not include state lobbying, where Duke also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. Duke spent $4,487,041 on lobbying in North Carolina from 2010 – 2016, and Duke’s lobbying over a pipeline that would cross the Appalachian Trail has attracted attention.[1]\\nDuke belongs to the Chamber of Commerce, which has spent over $1.5 billion on lobbying since 1998, and Business Roundtable (BRT), which spent $23,160,000 on lobbying for 2018 and is lobbying against shareholder rights to file resolutions. Duke discloses its trade association dues used for lobbying on its website, but fails to clarify if this captures all payments, leaving a loophole for additional payments beyond dues that could be used for lobbying, yet not be disclosed. Duke reportedly charges its customers for trade association dues.[2]\\xa0And Duke does not disclose its payments to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\\nWe are concerned that Duke’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. Duke has drawn scrutiny for signing the BRT Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation, yet also attending the ALEC annual conference.[3]\\nInvestors participating in the Climate Action 100+ representing $34 trillion in assets are asking companies to align their lobbying with the Paris agreement goals. Duke uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, yet currently fails to report “any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions” under GRI Standard 415.\\n',\n",
       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders of Duke Energy Corporation (“Duke”) ask the Board of Directors to adopt a policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require the Chair of the Board to be an independent director. The policy should provide that (i) if the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the policy within 60 days of that determination; and (ii) compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.\\nThis policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn our view, shareholder value is enhanced by an independent Board Chair who can provide a balance of power between the chief executive officer (“CEO”) and the Board and support strong Board oversight of management. According to proxy advisor Glass Lewis “shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the Company and set a pro-shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a CEO or other executive also serves as chairman.”\\n\\xa0\\nWhile separating the roles of Chair and CEO is the norm in Europe, 53% of S&P 500 boards have also implemented this leading practice. Directors on boards with a joint CEO-Chair report being more likely to have difficulty voicing a dissenting view (57% versus 41%) and to believe that one or more of their fellow directors should be replaced (61% versus 47%) according to a 2019 survey by PwC.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nExcept for two transition periods, Duke CEOs have also served as Chair of the Board since 1999. Duke’s lack of independent board leadership may be aggravated by the fact that its long-serving “Independent Lead Director,” Michael Browning, age 73, has served on the boards of Duke and predecessor companies since 1990. Duke’s corporate governance principles state that independent directors normally retire when they reach age 70 or 15 years of service. According to ISS Governance QualityScore, “an excessive tenure is considered to potentially compromise a director’s independence.” Institutional investor CalPERS classifies directors with a tenure exceeding 12 years as not independent.\\n\\xa0\\nWe believe independent Board leadership would be particularly useful to oversee the strategic transformation necessary for Duke to capitalize on the opportunities available in the transition to a low carbon economy.\\xa0While Duke has been applauded for its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, its near term capital expenditures have been criticized for their continued reliance on fossil fuel expansion.[1]\\xa0An independent chair may help the Board recognize the risk that excessive investment in natural gas infrastructure could become a stranded asset.[2]\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWe urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.\\n',\n",

A key strategic risk now facing pharmaceutical firms is backlash against the high price of medicines. The effects of high drug prices on patient access, government payer budgets and the broader health care system have kept drug prices in the public spotlight, especially as campaigning for 2020 presidential and congressional elections intensifies. A 2019 Credit Suisse analyst report stated that US drug price rises contributed 33% of industry net income growth in 2018 and noted strong political pressure to reduce absolute drug prices. (Global Pharmaceuticals, Future of US Drug Rebates Under Review, Apr. 29, 2019, at 4)Lilly has faced intense scrutiny over pricing of its insulin: The Senate Finance Committee launched an investigation in early 2019, requesting extensive information on pricing, marketing costs and research and development,1 and Attorneys General from eight states and the District of Columbia have formally or informally sought information from Lilly about insulin pricing.2 Media reports regularly highlight increases in the cost of Lilly's Humalog alongside stories of patients rationing or going without insulin due to cost.3 We are concerned that Lilly's senior executive incentive compensation arrangements may not encourage consideration of risks created by high prices. For example, Lilly uses revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as metrics for the annual bonus, and EPS growth as the metric for performance awards. (2019 Proxy Statement, at 43-46) Income/EPS and especially revenue are sensitive to price increases: In 2016, price increases accounted for at least 100% of Lilly's EPS growth, according to Credit Suisse. (Global Pharma and Biotech Sector Review: Exploring Future US Pricing Pressure, Apr. 18, 2017, at 1) Dependence on drug price increases create significant risks, which may be exacerbated when price hikes drive large senior executive payouts.Accordingly, we believe it is advisable for the Committee to explore incorporating measures that relate to the financial and strategic risks created by high drug prices into senior executive compensation arrangements. This Proposal gives the Committee total discretion in selecting potential measures and in analyzing the feasibility of incorporating them. By way of illustration, though, such measures could reward executives for increasing access or limit the extent to which price increases can be used to meet revenue and income targets.We urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.\\n\",\n",

Lilly also lobbies abroad, spending between 700,000-799,000 on lobbying in Europe for 2018.3 Lilly sits on the board of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and belongs to the Chamber of Commerce, which together have spent over $1.9 billion on lobbying since 1998.4 Lilly does not disclose its payments to trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. And Lilly does not disclose its contributions to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).We believe the reputational damage stemming from this misalignment between general policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by Lilly.

They swim trying to escape and avoid drowning. Eventually they stop struggling.Authors affiliated with our Company described the FST as a model or test of behavioral despair1 and published papers between 1993 and 2018 describing FST experiments in which 3,201 mice and 234 rats were used. None of the compounds tested are currently approved to treat depression. This represents a loss of time and resources to our Company, and animal suffering.Our Company uses the FST to purportedly test the antidepressant qualities of compounds2 on the assumption that the sooner the animal stops swimming, the more depressed the animal is. However, there is evidence that floating is an adaptive behavior that saves energy and benefits survival,3 and not a sign of depression.The FST's ability to accurately predict human antidepressants is further undermined since it yields positive results for compounds that are not prescribed as human antidepressants,4 and negative results for compounds that are.5 Therefore, antidepressant compounds may be abandoned if they do not produce desired results in the FST. The applicability of the FST to human depression has been refuted by experts,6 who cite the use of animal experiments such as the FST as a major reason for lack of effective treatments.7 Given the animal suffering inherent in the test and the 26 years of failure to produce human-relevant results, our Company has the ethical, fiscal, and scientific obligation to assess the FST and report its findings to shareholders\\n\",\n",

The Policy should provide that any third-party consultant asked to furnish an Initial List will be requested to include such candidates.\\nSupporting Statement:Expeditors International appears to have no people of color among its directors and CEO.A growing body of empirical research indicates a significant positive relationship between firm value and the percentage of women and minorities in leadership. A 2012 Credit Suisse Research Institute study found that companies with one or more women directors delivered higher average returns on equity, better average growth and higher price/book value multiples.1 A 2015 McKinsey study found that corporate leadership in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their national industry median.2Adopting a policy that requires consideration of women and minority candidates for every open director seat and external CEO search would assist the board in developing a diverse board and executive team. According to a 2016 Harvard Business Review study, including more than one woman or member of a racial minority in a finalist pool helps combat unconscious bias among interviewers and increases the likelihood of a diverse hire.3 We believe that all of our portfolio companies should have a robust diversity search policy in place to institutionalize the board's commitment to achieving and maintaining racial and gender diversity over the long term, including beyond the terms of the incumbent directors and CEO.The proposed rule resembles the Rooney Rule in the National Football League (NFL), which requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations openings and was recently expanded to include general manager jobs and equivalent front office positions. It does not dictate who should be hired, but instead widens the talent pool and requires a diverse set of candidates for consideration. While corporate boards may face differing circumstances, it is difficult to ignore the positive impact of the Rooney Rule on diversity. In the twelve years before the Rule was implemented, the NFL had four minority head coaches and one minority general manager. Twelve years after, the NFL had sixteen minority head coaches and eight minority general managers.4The Policy described in this Proposal would apply to only those CEO searches that consider candidates from outside Expeditors International. We do not intend for the Policy to be a substitute for robust internal succession planning, and we encourage Expeditors International to maintain and disclose a process for fostering a diverse talent pipeline for executive management.We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal.\\n\",\n",

The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, '[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.'Publicly available records show Exxon has contributed at least $12,900,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle. (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com; National Institute on Money in State Politics: http://www.followthemoney.org).We acknowledge that Exxon publicly discloses a policy on corporate political spending and its direct contributions to candidates, parties, and committees. We believe this is deficient because Exxon does not disclose the following: A full list of trade associations to which it belongs and the non-deductible portion under section 162(e)(1)(B) of the dues paid to each; and Payments to other third-party organizations, including those organized under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, that could be used for election-related purposes.Information on indirect electoral spending through trade associations and 501(c)(4) groups cannot be obtained by shareholders unless the Company discloses it. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, both direct and indirect. This would bring our company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including AT&T, United Technologies, and ConocoPhillips, which present this information on their websites. The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Investors are concerned about the financial, health, environmental, and reputational risks associated with operating and building-out new chemical plants and related infrastructure in Gulf Coast locations increasingly prone to catastrophic storms and flooding associated with climate change. Civil society groups have mobilized to oppose the expansion of petrochemical facilities in their communities due to concerns regarding direct health and livelihood impacts from air and water pollutant releases. Such opposition threatens to jeopardize ExxonMobil’s social license to operate in the region.\\nPetrochemical facilities like ethane crackers and polyethylene processing plants produce dangerous pollutants including benzene (a known carcinogen), Volatile Organic Compounds, and sulfur dioxide. These operations can become inundated and pose significant chemical release risks during extreme weather events. Flooding from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 resulted in ExxonMobil plant shut downs and the release of unpermitted, unsafe levels of pollutants. Nearby Houston residents reported respiratory and other health problems following ExxonMobil’s releases during Hurricane Harvey.\\nGrowing storms and the costs they bring our company are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as global warming escalates. Recent reports show that greenhouse gas emissions throughout the petrochemical and plastic supply chain contribute significantly to climate change, exacerbating the threat of physical risks like storms. Flood-related damage is projected to be highest in Texas, where many ExxonMobil petrochemical plants are concentrated. Houston alone has seen three 500-year floods in a three-year span. Hurricane Harvey contributed to decreased earnings of approximately $40 million for ExxonMobil in 2017 and decreasing social license from surrounding communities.\\nHistorically, releases from ExxonMobil’s petrochemical operations have exceeded legal limits, exposing the company to liability and millions in payment for violations of environmental laws including the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. As climate change intensifies flooding and storm strength, the potential for unplanned chemical releases grows.\\nIn spite of these risks, ExxonMobil continues to accelerate its petrochemical activity in the Gulf Coast, investing heavily to expand in flood-prone areas of Texas and Louisiana. The company has generally disclosed that risks from storms may impact its business and that climate risks like extreme storms are among the factors it considers in construction and operation of assets. The impacts to ExxonMobil’s operations from Hurricane Harvey, however, indicate the company’s level of preparedness is insufficient. As the Company rapidly expands its petrochemical assets in climate-impacted areas, investors seek improved disclosure to understand whether ExxonMobil is adequately evaluating and mitigating public health risks associated with climate-related impacts and the dangerous chemicals it uses.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that ExxonMobil with board oversight publish a report omitting proprietary information and prepared at reasonable cost assessing the public health risks of expanding petrochemical operations and investments in areas increasingly prone to climate change induced storms flooding and sea level rise.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nInvestors request the company assess, among other related issues at management and Board discretion: The adequacy of measures the company is employing to prevent public health impacts from associated chemical releases.\\n',\n",

Climate risk merits the creation of a board committee to help lead the necessary transition.\\nMajor oil companies face unprecedented disruption to their business driven by global imperatives to limit global warming and competition from non-carbon-emitting technologies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects dramatic drops in industry emissions of 50 to 90 percent by 2050 are necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.\\nAs fiduciaries, our board is responsible for stewardship of business performance and long-term strategic planning, in light of risk factors like climate science and policy.

How can the CEO be his own boss?\"\\xa0\\nIn our view, shareholders are best served by a separate independent Board Chair who provides a balance of power between the CEO and the Board. The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. A combined CEO / Chair creates a potential conflict of interest, resulting in excessive management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of management.\\xa0\\nNumerous institutional investors recommend separation of these two roles and the number of companies separating these roles is growing.\\xa0\\nWith the unprecedented climate change challenges facing global energy companies as they face important transitions to a low carbon economy, it is important to ensure our company\\'s governance is the best it can be, and the board is empowered to provide strong direction and leadership.

       " 'According to the Exxon Mobil chairman’s letter in the 2019 Energy & Carbon Summary, “There are few challenges more important than meeting the world’s growing demand for energy while reducing environmental impacts and the risks of climate change. Exxon Mobil is committed to doing our part to help society meet this dual challenge.” So, our company is clearly committed to addressing climate change.\\nBurning of fossil fuels has facilitated an unprecedented advancement of the standard of living. In addition to desirable results from using fossil fuels, negative effects of the use of fossil fuels are now well understood and our company faces a threat similar to that faced by tobacco companies in the 1960s and 70s. The product that Exxon Mobil legally sells and relies on for most of its revenue, has been determined, when used for the purpose for which it is sold, to have detrimental effects on the welfare of the users of the product as well as all of the residents of the planet. In coming years this fact can be expected to become more and more clear in the minds of the public. Intangible assets, which includes a company’s brand recognition and reputation, now account for 84% of a company’s value1.\\nExxon Mobil understands the need to take additional action so it can be seen to be a leader in transitioning the world to a carbon neutral economy and thus avoid the impacts to the value of the company due to negative public perception of the company regarding significant action to address climate change.\\n\\n1 https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/WealthManagementAmericas/documents/to-integrate-or-to-exclude-2015-3Q-sustainable-investing.pdf, accessed Dec. 7, 2019.\\n\\nResolved:\\nExxon Mobil resolves to support a pricing structure on fossil fuels that will lead to significant reduction in production of carbon dioxide.

To be seen as a leader in significant climate action Exxon Mobil would need to support a pricing structure on carbon at levels that would result in more significant reductions than the pricing structure advocated by the Climate Leadership Council.\\nUsing estimating tools2 it is clear that a carbon fee at the proposed levels would result in a significant reduction in the demand for fossil fuels.\\nWe urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.\\n',\n",

Therefore, oil and gas companies need the support of their shareholders to change course: first, to align their targets with the Paris Climate Agreement, and second, to invest accordingly in the energy transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.\\n\\nFiduciary duty\\nWe, the shareholders, understand this support to be part of our fiduciary duty. A growing international consensus has emerged among financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore achieving the goals of Paris is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy. Institutional investors foresee that they cannot make a decent return on capital in a world economy disrupted by devastating climate change.\\n\\nScope 3\\nReducing absolute emissions from the use of energy products (Scope 3) is crucial to achieving the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, and we therefore support you to include these in your targets.

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent annual “Emissions Gap Report” issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (November 26, 2019), critical gaps remain between the commitments national governments have made and the actions required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policy-makers to close these gaps.\\xa0\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational and legal risks to investors. These efforts also present systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, pose a systemic risk to economic stability and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks, and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\xa0\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but, unfortunately, too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\xa0\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C— as an imperative. We are convinced that unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of their portfolios. We see future “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater as both unacceptable and uninvestable.\\xa0\\nTwo hundred institutional investors managing $6.5 trillion recently wrote to ExxonMobil, seeking information on how the company is managing this critical governance issue.

This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where ExxonMobil also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, ExxonMobil spent $4,055,093 on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2018. Exxon also lobbies abroad, spending between €3,250,000 – €3,499,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2018.\\nExxonMobil belongs to the American Petroleum Institute, Business Roundtable (BRT), Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), which altogether spent $260,638,048 on lobbying for 2017 and 2018. Both the BRT and NAM are lobbying against shareholder rights to file resolutions. ExxonMobil does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying.\\nWe are concerned that ExxonMobil’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, yet a 2019 InfluenceMap report found Exxon has spent millions lobbying to undermine it. (https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/436117-top-oil-firms-spend-millions-on-lobbying-to-block-climate-change)\\nInvestors participating in the Climate Action 100+ representing more than $34 trillion in assets are asking companies to align their lobbying, including through their trade associations, with the goals of the Paris agreement. Peer Shell produced an “Industry Associations Climate Review” report to ensure its trade association participation aligned with its views. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-afpm-idUSKCN1RE0VB) ExxonMobil uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, yet fails to report “any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions” under GRI Standard 415.\\nWe believe the reputational damage stemming from this misalignment between general policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by ExxonMobil. Thus, we urge ExxonMobil to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n',\n",

We estimate these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year... To put this in perspective, the Federal Trade Commission fine that these same critics said wouldn't be enough to change our incentives was more than 10 times bigger than this.Whereas, this relaxation of standards subjects the company to material costs and risks in an environment of greater regulation and negative publicity which may even prove existential for the company. A recent European Court ruling regarding the defamation of an Austrian politician on Facebook decided European country courts have jurisdiction over Facebook's content internationally if it was found to be defamatory or otherwise illegal.

Yet despite Facebook's subsequent ban of white nationalist content, that content has been shared 4.5 million times on the platform since March 2019.In Myanmar, where violence against the Rohingya bears the hallmarks of genocide, a human rights report, commissioned by Facebook, showed the company created an enabling environment for the ongoing endorsement and proliferation of human rights abuse in Myanmar.

Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.Women account for 36.9 percent of our company's workforce and 32.6 percent of leadership. Actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.Assessing if a company has pay gaps requires analyzing both equal pay and equal opportunity. This is done using adjusted and unadjusted (median) pay data. The objective of this proposal-median pay gap disclosure-addresses the structural bias affecting the jobs women and minorities hold, when white men hold most higher paying jobs. It is the key metric used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Economic Forum, and United States Department of Labor.United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay numbers, assessing the pay of men and women, minorities and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but ignore unadjusted median pay gaps. Facebook reports women and minorities earn 100 percent the compensation received by men on an equal pay basis. Yet, that adjusted number is only half the story, failing to consider how discrimination affects opportunity.The United Kingdom mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Facebook reported a 11.9 percent median base pay gap and a 41.6 percent bonus gap in the United Kingdom, but has not published its global median pay gap.Public policy risk is of concern. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends before the United States Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request Facebook report on the company's global median gender/racial pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information.The gender pay gap is the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders request the Board of Directors adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, be an independent member of the Board. This independence policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligations. If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been Board Chair since 2012. His dual-class shareholdings give him approximately 58% of Facebook’s voting shares while holding only 13% of the economic interest, leaving the board, even with a lead independent director, with only a limited ability to check Mr. Zuckerberg’s power. We believe this weakens Facebook’s governance and oversight of management. Selecting an independent Chair would free the CEO to focus on managing the Company and enable the Chairperson to focus on oversight and strategic guidance.\\nFacebook has resisted recent shareholder requests to separate these roles. At the 2019 annual meeting, according to our calculations, this proposal received the support of 68% of the votes cast when excluding the shares of 13 executives and board members. However, the board has not acted on this important signal from its non-insider shareholders.\\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Autodesk all have separate CEO and chairperson roles.\\nWe believe this lack of independent board Chair and oversight has contributed to Facebook missing, or mishandling, a number of severe controversies, increasing risk exposure and costs to shareholders.\\nConcentrating power in the hands of one person – any person – is unwise. Looking forward to future growth opportunities, we believe Facebook needs strong risk oversight and to rebuild trust with investors, employees, users, and regulators. Transitioning to an independent board chair is necessary to rebuild the company’s reputation and to create a governance environment with the benefits of genuine accountability and meaningful oversight.\\n',\n",

ESG is defined as the framework for understanding how environmental, social and governance considerations, and related financial impacts, are integrated into corporate strategy over the long term.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nStrong management of ESG risks has a positive effect on long-term shareholder value. Failure to adequately manage and disclose performance on ESG issues can pose regulatory, legal, reputational and financial risks to a company and its shareholders.\\xa0\\nAccording to the 2019 UN Global Compact CEO Study, 84% of executives from the world’s largest companies cited a clear link between sustainability and business value and 66% of CEOs would agree to have their compensation linked to sustainability performance. A recent Mercer study found 30% of respondents use ESG metrics in their incentive compensation plans and 21% more are considering incorporating such metrics.\\xa0\\nEffectively managing ESG issues offers positive opportunities for companies and should be a key metric by which executives are judged. By integrating ESG metrics into executive compensation, companies can reduce risks related to underperformance by incentivizing executives to meet sustainability goals, thereby achieving greater long-term value.\\xa0\\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board identifies FedEx’s ESG materiality issues as greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, labor practices, employee health and safety, supply chain management, and accident and safety management. While FedEx has taken steps to address these issues, it has not explicitly integrated ESG metrics into executive incentives, which could encourage executives to prioritize these goals.\\xa0\\nFor example, FedEx has adopted strong emission reduction goals. Integrating those related metrics into compensation may encourage executives to achieve these goals. Furthermore, FedEx has shown an interest in measuring a segment of overall named executive officers’ performance based on diversity and inclusion for their incentive pay metrics. But FedEx provides no performance measures, goals, or results associated with this objective.\\xa0\\nShareholders are concerned that FedEx has also demonstrated weak performance related to several ESG issues that could impact long-term value, including:\\xa0\\n• Lawsuits and controversies related to workers’ rights and labor issues, including alleged misclassification of employees.\\xa0\\n• Weak health and safety goals and performance related to lost time due to incidents and on the job fatalities.\\xa0\\n• Executive compensation practices opposed by 24.9% of shareholders at its most recent advisory vote on executive compensation.\\xa0\\nFedEx’s performance on material ESG issues can impact long-term value.

Women enter the workforce in almost equal numbers as men (48%). However, they only comprise 22% of the executive suite; as a percentage of representation, this indicates a drop of 26%. Similarly, people of color comprise 33% of entry level positions, but only 13% of the c-suite.(3)In November, 2019, Fortinet published a report titled Why Gender Diversity in Cybersecurity Matters to the Business: Filling the Skills Gap by Closing the Gender Gap along with online articles on the benefits of gender diversity in cybersecurity. As Philip Quade, Fortinet's Chief Information Security Officer stated We need to reimagine how the industry attracts, trains and retains great talent.

The work won a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting in 2018.The Indianapolis Star broke the story - which eventually went national, - about sexual abuse allegations at USA Gymnastics. The Star was the first to identify Larry Nassar, the team doctor, as a suspect. Nassar has since been accused of molesting more than 150 girls and is now serving a 175-year prison sentence. The reporting won an Investigative Reporters and Editors Award for investigative reporting in 2016.Reporters at The Sarasota Herald Tribune linked deep budget cuts within Florida's mental health system to a spike in systemic violence and abuse at its state-run hospitals. It won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2016.This is high quality journalism, and we could cite many other examples at Gannett papers. Our proposal seeks to ensure that community journalism is measured and maintained. Studies have shown that areas where local news has been severely diminished, where civic institutions aren't monitored as closely, have seen municipal bond rates increase and civic involvement decline. Recent research from the University of Illinois-Chicago and the University of Notre Dame found that communities that have become news deserts also pay higher taxes and are at greater risk of political corruption. Other studies show lower voter turnout and increased partisanship.While our company currently measures its revenue, expenses, and profitability attached to creating news, it does not reveal to investors the impact its choices about news coverage might be having.We believe tracking and reporting on our core service news is critical for investors to assess our company. Measured much like environmental sustainability reports, the internal audit that we propose could include baseline data on insourcing/outsourcing, staffing, beats covered at each property, geographic coverage areas, and the number of days published year to year, among other metrics. For investors concerned about the fate of journalism, such public monitoring represents a means to understanding how our company creates value.Brand and reputation matter.

For example, GM suppliers may source cobalt mined under conditions of child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 60% of cobalt is produced and child labor is pervasive.2 Reports by Amnesty International and the 2019 Mining the Disclosures benchmark found GM's cobalt due diligence practices to be inadequate given its awareness of the risk.3 Sourcing of conflict minerals, steel, rubber, mica, electronics, and leather also present human rights risks for GM.4In its operations, nearly 50,000 members of the GM United Auto Workers union went on strike for six weeks to collectively bargain for higher wages, job security for temporary workers, and better healthcare.5 The strike cost GM up to $4 billion inearnings.6 GM faces multiple lawsuits alleging harassment and discrimination at its Toledo plant from employees who experienced intimidation, threats, and racism in the workplace.7While GM has policies in place, it does not demonstrate how its Human Rights Policy, Code of Conduct, and Supplier Code are operationalized to ensure human rights are respected.

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by GEO used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. GEO's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of management's and the Board's decision making process and oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above.For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which GEO is a member.Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on GEO's website.\\nSupporting Statement:As shareholders, we encourage transparency and accountability in our company's use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. GEO has spent $7.13 million from 2010 - 2018 on federal lobbying, including $1.7 million in 2017, which reportedly was the highest amount in a year for a private prison.1 These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where GEO also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, GEO had at least 67 lobbyists in 16 states in 2018 (followthemoney.org). GEO spent $1,500,000 on lobbying in Alabama for 20182 and $3,995,000 on lobbying in Florida from 2012 - 2017.3 And GEO's lobbying over how long immigrant children in Texas can be detained has attracted negative scrutiny.4GEO is a member of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which spent over $7.8 million on lobbying in 2017 and 2018. GEO is also listed as a member of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, which had at least 25 lobbyists in Florida in 2017.5 GEO does not comprehensively disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. Absent a system of accountability, company assets could be used for objectives contrary to GEO's long-term interests.We are concerned that GEO's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks, and thus we urge the Board to institute comprehensive lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",

At the current rate, women overall will not reach pay equity until 2059, African American women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224.Research suggests diverse leadership leads to superior stock performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling. Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.Women account for 26.8 percent of our company's workforce, but only 19.4 percent of leadership. Actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.Assessing if a company has pay gaps requires analyzing both equal pay and equal opportunity. This is done using adjusted and unadjusted (median) pay data. The objective of this proposal-median pay gap disclosure-addresses the structural bias affecting the jobs women and minorities hold, when white men hold most higher paying jobs. It is the key metric used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Economic Forum, and United States Department of Labor.United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay numbers, assessing the pay of men and women, minorities and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but ignore unadjusted median pay gaps. Intel reports women and minorities earn 100 percent the compensation received by men and non-minorities on an equal pay basis. Yet, that adjusted number is only half the story, failing to consider how discrimination affects opportunity.The United Kingdom mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Intel reported a 32.5 percent median base pay gap and a 45.2 percent bonus gap in the United Kingdom, but has not published its global median pay gap.Public policy risk is of concern.

McKinsey & Company, found in 2015, and in a larger 2017 study that highly diverse executive teams had higher returns on equity and earnings performance than those with low diversity. ISS Analytics examined companies where the CEO had a tenure of at least three years and found companies that combined gender diversity in the boardroom and the C-Suite showed, overall, the best results in terms of risk-adjusted quality of performance. (ISS Analytics/Governance Insights/October, 2018)Yet, the number of women and people of color in leadership roles remains low. Nine percent of top executive roles in the Russell 3000 are held by women. Among S&P500 companies women comprise 44.7 percent of all employees yet just 26.5 percent of executives, senior officials and managers. Women of color face a wider gap.Companies across industries are setting goals to address this significant issue. Intel has been tracking diversity data since 2014 and ties diversity goals to incentive compensation. In 2018, two years ahead of schedule, Intel achieved full representation of underrepresented minorities and women in its U.S. workforce. Symantec set a goal to increase the percentage of women in leadership (Director-level and above) to thirty percent by 2020. Citigroup, in 2018, announced plans to reverse falling diversity by setting public quantitative goals and holding senior leaders accountable for meeting them.IPG Photonics has strengthened diversity on its board of directors. It is time to extend focus and accountability to building diversity in its leadership ranks.To address the lack of diversity in senior roles we believe the Board must set clear policies to attract, retain and promote women and people of color, including reporting on gender pay equity, establishing sponsorship programs, and family support programs.Further, we believe that linking diversity performance metrics to senior executive compensation packages can sharpen management's ability to manage human capital risks, increase accountability and successfully reach inclusion and diversity goals.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors prepare a report (at a reasonable cost, in a reasonable time, and omitting confidential information) providing its assessment of the current state of its management team diversity and if and how it plans to make the Company's management team more diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender.Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess IPG Photonic's strategy and performance could include disclosures such as use of Rooney Rule practices when interviewing for open positions, and hiring and promotion rates of women and people of color across employment.\\n\",\n",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017, opioid abuse caused an average of over 130 overdose deaths per day. The economic and social effects of the opioid crisis have been profound. A recent report pegged the cumulative economic toll of the opioid epidemic at over $1 trillion.1 Opioid use and dependency, according to a 2017 study, is a key factor in the decline in prime-age male labor force participation.2 Sale of opioid medications creates legal and reputational risks for JNJ. JNJ recently received a grand jury subpoena from a New York U.S. Attorney's Office related to the sale of opioids made by subsidiary Janssen.3 In August 2019, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Janssen engaged in false, deceptive and misleading marketing regarding opioids that contributed to the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, which constituted a public nuisance, and awarded the state of Oklahoma $572 million.4 JNJ has offered to pay $4 billion to settle over 2,000 lawsuits by state and local governments claiming that JNJ's marketing of opioid drugs, as well as its sale of opioid active ingredients to other drug makers, contributed to the opioid crisis.5 In our view, Board-level oversight and governance reforms can play an important role in effectively addressing opioid-related risks and shareholders would benefit from a fuller understanding of how JNJ's governance arrangements have changed since 2012 to do so more effectively.For example, reports indicate that JNJ has begun centralizing its famously decentralized corporate structure, including the compliance function,6 which could be expected to affect Board oversight of risks related to opioids. As well, it is not clear from JNJ's proxy statements whether senior executive compensation incentives have changed to promote compliance or ethical behavior.We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.\\n\",\n",

Particular subsectors of fossil fuels, including Arctic and Canadian tar sands (also referred to as oil sands), have become hot button political issues, because of their particular impacts on the climate, the local environment, and Indigenous rights. Protests surrounding the Keystone XL and Line 3 pipelines and opposition to drilling in the Arctic are among the high-profile concerns. JPMorgan is reportedly the largest global lender and underwriter to the top 30 companies operating in Arctic oil and gas, and the top U.S. lender and underwriter to the top 34 tar sands companies, which has led to JPMorgan being the target of significant protests – often led by Indigenous peoples.\\nAccording to a poll conducted in 2017 by Yale and George Mason University, 70% of American voters oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[1] In September 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 225-193 to reinstate a ban on drilling the refuge. August 2019 reporting revealed that in reality, ANWR may not contain very much oil amid accusations that boosters in Washington are exaggerating the extent of the resource, thus supporting this activity is likely far riskier than previously thought.[2] Beyond ANWR, drilling anywhere in the Arctic threatens Indigenous rights and impacts a fragile ecosystem.\\nWhile JPMorgan has an enhanced due diligence process for transactions related to Arctic oil and gas, HSBC, BNP Paribas, and Société Générale have made commitments to restrict financing for oil and gas production in the Arctic.[3] For example, BNP Paribas prohibits all financing for all Arctic oil and gas projects, and commits to phase out some financing for and/or exclude some Arctic oil and gas companies.\\nSimilarly, tar sands production and transport is becoming increasingly controversial and economically unviable, as multinational oil firms are rapidly exiting the industry. Recently, Kinder Morgan, ConocoPhillips, Devon, and Equinor have sold out of their oil sands projects.[4]\\nIn August 2019, JPMorgan’s CEO Jaime Dimon led 180 other members of the Business Roundtable in expressing his commitment to deliver value to all of the company’s stakeholders.

       " 'A portion of Kroger house brand product packaging is unrecyclable, including plastics, which are a growing component of plastic pollution and marine litter. Authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life, spreads toxics, and poses a potential threat to human health. The environmental cost of consumer plastic products and packaging exceeds $139 billion annually, according to the American Chemistry Council.\\n\\nPlastic is the fastest growing form of packaging; U.S. flexible plastic sales are estimated at $26 billion. Dried fruit, frozen meat, cheese, and dog food are some of the Kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches. Private label items account for a quarter of all sales – nearly $20 billion annually. Using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources.\\xa0\\n\\nRecyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious, yet recycling rates stagnate. Only 13% of plastic packaging is recycled, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Billions of pouches and similar multi-layer plastic laminates, lie buried in landfills. Unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways. An assessment of marine debris by the Global Environment Facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is “design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled…”\\n\\nIn the marine environment, plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food. Studies by the EPA suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic chemicals. Plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets. If no actions are taken, oceans are expected to contain more plastic than fish by 2050!\\xa0\\n\\nMaking all packaging recyclable, if possible, is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by plastic pollution. Better management of plastic could save consumer goods companies $4 billion a year. Companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging.\\xa0\\n\\nOther companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability.\\xa0Kroger is lagging behind competitors; the company has only offered a vague statement that it will strive to increase recyclability of its plastic packaging.

       " \"Resolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on Kroger's human rights due diligence (HRDD) process to identify, assess, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse human rights impacts in its operations and supply chain.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement:In line with the HRDD approach outlined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,1 we recommend the report include:The human rights principles used to frame its risk assessments;The human rights impacts of Kroger's business activities, including company-owned operations and supply chain, and plans to mitigate adverse impacts;The types and extent of stakeholder consultation; andThe company's plans to track effectiveness of measures to assess, prevent, mitigate, and remedy adverse human rights impacts.These HRDD measures reduce long-term risk to shareholders. Companies that proactively identify and mitigate human rights abuses avoid costly backlash from communities, customers, and government regulators. Indeed, risks exist not only for companies directly producing products connected to human rights violations, but also those selling such products.2 For supermarkets, this creates an imperative not to cause or contribute to abuses to workers and farmers in their supply chain. Given Kroger's business relationship with suppliers operating in high-risk sectors, the company's current business model exposes investors to significant reputational - and in turn, financial - risk.Increased public scrutiny on industries reliant upon child and forced labor has magnified the reputational risk: media coverage by the NY Times detailed slave labor in Southeast Asia's shrimp industry;3 the Wall Street Journal revealed migrant labor abuses in Malaysia's palm oil sector;4 and CNN chronicled rampant labor abuse among U.S. tomato producers.5 When these tainted products are connected to a brand, the reputational stain follows.6 Responsible companies must strive to identify, remedy and prevent such human rights violations.Kroger is not immune to these threats. The Department of Labor has identified dozens of food products that appear on Kroger's shelves produced from child or forced labor, including seafood, tea, palm oil and fresh produce.7Transparency in supply chain sourcing can reduce these risks. Companies that know, show, and address supply chain risks not only garner positive attention and customer loyalty for sustainable practices, but head off potentially expensive reputational risks. Companies like Coca-Cola and Mondelez, and supermarkets Jumbo, Albert Heijn, and Tesco have all conducted or committed to implementing HRDD, including by conducting human rights impact assessments on their sourcing of agricultural commodities.Given the low cost of integrating HRDD relative to the significant costs that companies bear when tied to human rights violations, shareholders urge the Board to adopt this measure as a cost-effective means of reducing exposure to risk and maximizing long-term financial interest.\\n\",\n",

The labor-intensive assembly of E-System products takes place in countries with low wages and risks of poor working conditions.6 Lear has many E-Systems facilities in China, where forced labor and child labor risks are present in electronics and manufacturing.7 Lear cites risks of labor disputes in its plants. For example, Lear fired a whistleblower and threatened and harassed employees at its Selma, AL plant who spoke to federal investigators about health and safety concerns.8Lear has a Supplier Sustainability Policy and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but investors and customers are unable to evaluate the extent to which these policies address its most salient risks. Lear also lacks a No Deforestation policy. Lear may face legal, reputational, competitive, and financial risks if the company fails to effectively assess and manage its human rights risks, such as the risk of enforcement actions by U.S. Custom and Border Protection that interfere with business continuity.Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to respect human rights within their operations and throughout their value chains by conducting due diligence to assess, identify, prevent, mitigate, and remediate adverse human rights impacts.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request that Lear Corporation (Lear) publish a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, with the results of a Human Rights Impact Assessment examining the actual and potential human rights impacts of the company's high-risk business activities in its operations and value chain.\\n\",\n",

The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making.The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting StatementAs long-term shareholders of Loews, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, [D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.Relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including American International Group Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., and MetLife Inc., which present this information on their websites.The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.\\n\",\n",
       " \"RESOLVED: Given the cruel and inhumane treatment endured by birds used for down, the Board is strongly encouraged to enact a policy ensuring that no products containing down are sold by lululemon athletica inc.\\nSupporting Statement:SUPPORTING STATEMENT:Birds used for down are often subjected to intensive confinement on filthy factory farms before they're loaded onto open-air trucks, exposed to all weather extremes, and hauled to the slaughterhouse. A PETA eyewitness expose revealed that birds raised for down were crammed into cages for transport with such force that many sustained bruises, broken bones, and dislocated joints. The cages were so small that the birds were unable to hold their heads up even while sitting, and they were left in the feces-strewn crates for up to 24 hours without food or water. At the slaughterhouse, they're often improperly and ineffectively stunned before their throats are cut and they're dumped into the scalding-hot water of the defeathering tank.Selling down--a product that causes so much suffering--is not only cruel but also inconsistent with our company's promotion of compassion and environmental stewardship as well as its yoga-inspired vision of being part of an elevated world that operates within nature's boundaries. Condoning the cruelty inherent in down production is in stark contrast to lululemon's purported values.Our company understands the benefits of cruelty-free synthetic materials, as it already sells high-quality alternatives to down. Phasing out down would be easy as well as a compassionate choice.By eliminating down from its offerings, lululemon would prevent an enormous amount of suffering for birds and demonstrate that it is highly innovative, distinctive, competitive, and humane.Accordingly, we urge shareholders to support this ethically responsible resolution.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Whereas: Marathon Petroleum states that the well-being of our employees, contractors and neighboring communities is our highest priority...[and] minimizing our environmental impact is a serious priority.1 Marathon has one of the largest inventory of toxic hydrogen fluoride among US refiners subjecting the company to myriad risks. According to the EPA, Marathon's Garyville, Louisiana facility handles 445 tons on site - the most hydrogen fluoride of any of the 48 U.S. refineries reporting inventories. Its Texas City, Texas facility reported storing 180 tons to the EPA.In June 2019, an explosion of hydrogen fluoride at a Philadelphia oil refinery, which stores less than one half the amount stored at Marathon's Garyville plant, injured workers, drew national attention, disrupted the community, and sent gasoline prices upward revealing the deadly harm and risks this chemical can cause - especially for neighboring communities.However, safer alternatives exist. For example, some refineries are using safer catalysts such as advanced sulfuric acid and ionic liquids that have a dramatically lower risk of contributing to an explosion that would threaten surrounding communities.At the same time, Marathon's inability to attend to the community concerns of its Detroit neighbors has led to considerable negative press attention and a local congressional hearing on pollution. At a September 2019 hearing, US Representative Tlaib called into question Marathon's commitment to community well-being after citing recent vapor leaks that sent workers to hospitals. She drew public attention to 13 documented violations of air permits and the Clean Air Act over six years at Marathon's Detroit refinery. These releases reportedly sent cancer causing toxic chemicals into nearby neighborhoods.In 2019, Marathon's CEO signed the Business Roundtable's statement2 on the purpose of the corporation joining 180 CEOs who publicly commit to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders - customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders. Implementing this commitment will require Marathon to include a broader set of stakeholders into its decision making. We believe that in order to deliver value to communities where it operates Marathon will need mechanisms that better align its community impact and executive compensation incentives.For example, Newfield Exploration's incentive plan now includes community engagement among other more common metrics such as environment and safety factors.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: shareholders request the Board's Compensation Committee publish a report (at reasonable expense, within a reasonable time, and omitting confidential or propriety information) assessing the feasibility of integrating community stakeholder concerns and impacts into Marathon's executive compensation program which it describes in its annual proxy materials.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: According to pages 30-34 of Company's 2018 proxy materials, the Annual Cash Bonus program includes internal safety and environmental performance metrics. While these are necessary and positive, community stakeholder concerns and impacts are a distinct and vitally important issue for Marathon and should be included, as we believe it would incentivize leadership to improve community relations and impact, reduce risk, enhance financial performance, and increase accountability.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Resolved:\\nShareholders of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (the \"Company\") urge the Board of Directors (the \" Board\" ) to take the steps necessary to adopt a policy to require that the Chairman of the Board be an independent director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the Company. The policy should be implemented so as not to violate any contractual obligations, with amendments to the Company\\'s governing documents as needed. The policy should also specify the process for selecting a new independent Chairman if the current Chairman ceases to be independent between annual meetings of shareholders. Compliance with the policy may be excused if no independent director is available and willing to be Chairman.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nCEO Gary Heminger has also been the Chairman of the Board since 2016. We believe that combining the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board both weakens the corporation’s governance and places an undue burden on a single person. In our view, the Chairman should be an independent director, who has not previously served as an executive, in order to provide robust oversight and accountability of management, and to facilitate effective deliberation of corporate strategy, which we believe, is difficult to accomplish when the CEO serves as Chairman.\\nThe Board is responsible for monitoring the CEO\\'s performance, for providing objective guidance to t he CEO and for determining the CEO\\'s compensation. Having an individual chair the Board that is tasked wit h measuring his job performance and determining his compensation has the potential to weaken t he Board\\'s oversight and may lessen shareholder confidence. In addition, of great importance to any company\\'s success is the value of external perspectives, which can be accomplished by having an independent Board. However, we believe that this benefit is nullified for the Chairman when he also serves as the CEO.\\nFrom a 2016 report drafted by Glass Lewis, a prominent proxy advisory service, \"It is the board\\'s responsibility to select a chief executive who can best serve the Company and its shareholders and to replace this person when his or her duties have not been appropriately fulfilled. We believe replacing a CEO becomes more difficult and happens less frequently than it should when the chief executive is also in the position of overseeing the board.\"\\nIn the same report, Glass Lewis cites a 2009 study from the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance at the Yale School of Management that states, \" \"[t]he independent chair curbs conflicts of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the relationship between the board and CEO, serves as conduit for regular communication with shareowners, and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board.\"\\nWe do not believe that having a lead independent director is a sufficient alternative to an independent Chairman. In our view, an independent Chairman can increase investor confidence in our Company and provide for enhanced oversight of our CEO.\\nFor these reason, we urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution.\\n',\n",
       " \"The business case for workforce diversity is compelling. McKinsey & Company, for example, found in 2015, and in a larger study in 2017 that highly diverse executive teams had higher returns on equity and earnings performance than those with low diversity. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 21 percent more likely to have industry-leading profitability. Companies in the top quartile for ethnic/cultural diversity were 33 percent more likely to have industry-leading profitability.1In 2019, Marriott's CEO signed the Business Roundtable's Statement2 on the Purpose of a Corporation, joining 180 chief executives who publicly commit to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders-customers, employees, suppliers, communities, the environment and shareholders. Further, Marriott states our Company has one of the most diverse and inclusive workforces and we value the differences of our associates as a strategic business priority.3 However, Marriott does not disclose comprehensive workforce data or share results of its efforts to expand diversity and foster inclusion thereby leaving one with an insufficient understanding of successes or challenges.Peer companies including Starbucks, McDonalds and Nike publish workforce composition data by race, ethnicity and/or gender as well as approaches to foster inclusion and expand diversity in their employment. Several companies have set targets including Intel which set measurable targets for raising the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce. Symantec created a sub-goal of increasing the percentage of women in leadership (Director-level and above) to 30 percent by 2020. Financial services sector companies similarly have begun setting diversity targets. Citigroup, in August 2018, announced plans to reverse falling diversity by setting public quantitative goals and holding senior leaders accountable for meeting them.Companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion as business and social imperatives. Leveraging the contributions of a diverse employee population creates an environment in which individual differences and capabilities are valued. Further, operationalizing an effective inclusion and diversity strategy requires inclusive leadership and goal setting. Companies that hold themselves publicly accountable to diversity goals are more likely to make rapid progress toward achieving those goals. 1 McKinsey & Company, Delivering through Diversity; V.

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.2. Payments by MAXIMUS used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.3. MAXIMUS's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.4. Description of management's and the Board's decision-making process and oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above.For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which MAXIMUS is a member.Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committee and posted on MAXIMUS's website.\\nSupporting Statement:As shareholders, we encourage transparency and accountability in MAXIMUS's use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. MAXIMUS spent $4,687,102 from 2010 - 2018 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where MAXIMUS also lobbies in 33 states5 but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, MAXIMUS had at least 140 lobbyists in 23 states in 2018 (followthemoney.org). MAXIMUS spent $1,960,081 on lobbying in New York and had lobbying contracts worth a total of $1,425,000 to $2,615,000 in Texas from 2011 - 2018. MAXIMUS's lobbying to run public benefit programs at the local, state and federal levels has attracted negative attention.6 And MAXIMUS also lobbies abroad, and its lobbying over Work Capability Assessments contracts in the United Kingdom has drawn scrutiny.7MAXIMUS does not disclose its membership in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. Trade associations spend millions annually lobbying indirectly on behalf of companies. And MAXIMUS does not disclose memberships in tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council. Absent a system of accountability, company assets could be used for objectives contrary to MAXIMUS's long-term interests.We believe MAXIMUS's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks that could harm long-term value creation by MAXIMUS, and thus we urge the Board to institute comprehensive lobbying disclosure.\\xa0\\n\",\n",

       " \"Resolved:\\xa0The shareholders request the board of directors of Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) to issue a report, prepared at a reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, describing how the Company plans to allocate tax savings that result from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).\\nSupporting Statement:The TCJA reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21%, and transformed the provisions requiring companies pay taxes on money earned abroad. These changes helped reduce federal corporate income tax collections by nearly $100 billion, representing more than a 30% decline.1 One of the overarching goals of the legislation was to boost companies' long-term investment in the American economy. While still early, there has been no discernible boost in capital formation attributable to the tax reform.2 Without more detailed information, investors cannot tell whether a company's strategy on how to allocate its tax savings aligns with long-term value creation.We believe this information is important for investors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently stated: Companies have not been explicit enough about their long-term strategies. In the United States, for example, companies should explain to investors how the significant changes to tax law fit into their long-term strategy. What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use itto create long-term value? This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors.Merck received an estimated $1.2 billion in tax savings in 2018 from two provisions of the TCJA. Through 2025, the Company will receive an estimated $6.9 billion tax cut on previously un-taxed offshore profits.3Merck has an opportunity to strengthen its longer-term value creation by investing in workers, benefits, jobs, communities, capital investments, and R&D. Yet, in contrast to dozens of companies which have shared how they will spend the tax savings to create long-term value,4 Merck has not done so adequately. Without any specificity or discussion of these investments, investors cannot understand how the tax law affects the Company's long-term strategy to create value.When polled, 52% of Americans thought the tax savings should go towards worker pay, new jobs, and giving back to communities. Passing savings onto shareholders ranked as the lowest priority.5Merck more than doubled its share repurchases from $4 billion in 2017 to $9 billion last year. The Company increased its property plant and equipment by just 3%, and its R&D dropped by $456 million in 2018.6 All told, Merck was reported to have allocated 81% of its tax cuts to shareholders.7 These practices suggest the Company is not prioritizing long-term value creation.We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal.\\n\",\n",

MGE Energy will be expected to make radical changes over the next 20 years, to deal with reducing their contribution to the carbon dioxide released from the use of fossil fuels and to respond to climate change induced problems such as increased frequency of extreme weather events. The board can expect a higher level of analysis and interest regarding their ability to implement change to successfully deal with climate change risks. This increased scrutiny will come from potential new employees, shareholders, rate payers and regulators.For the last two years MGE Energy has embarked on a commendable path aimed at reducing fossil fuel carbon emissions as is evidenced by the 2030 Energy Framework and the commitment to net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. Effective implementation of these plans and goals is essential to the future economic success of the company. Strong leadership from the board will be critical in meeting these goals. This board level leadership must include in- depth knowledge and awareness of the risks and opportunities presented by a changing climate. The required scientific familiarity might include public health, sustainability, environmental health, and climate change/atmospheric science. A lack of this expertise may lead to a lack of confidence from investors as well as hindering efforts to continue MGE's successful performance.While current board members may have an interest in and peripheral knowledge of environmental issues, this is no substitute for actual expertise recognized by both the scientific and business communities. We shareholders believe that expertly addressing climate change issues at the strategic board level is necessary to insure the future success of MGE Energy.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Resolved: Shareholders of Mondelez International, Inc. request that the Compensation Committee ofthe Board of Directors take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Companyemployees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee should describe in theCompany's proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies with this requested policy. Compliancewith this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existingcompensation plan.\\nSupporting Statement:This proposal encourages the Compensation Committee to consider whether the CEO'scompensation is internally aligned with the Company's pay practices for its other employees. Under this proposal, theCompensation Committee will have discretion to determine how other employees' pay should influence CEOcompensation. This proposal does not require the Compensation Committee to use employee pay data in a specific wayto set CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks.Like at many companies, our Company's Compensation Committee has used peer group benchmarks of what othercompanies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These target pay amounts are then subject toperformance adjustments. To ensure that our Company's CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company'soverall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should also consider thepay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts.Over time, using peer group benchmarks as the primary measure to set CEO compensation targets can lead to payinflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies havetargeted their CEO's pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger or moresuccessful companies where CEO compensation is higher. (Charles Elson and Craig Ferrere, Executive Superstars, PeerGroups and Overcompensation, Journal of Corporation Law, Spring 2013).High levels of CEO pay relative to other employees may hurt organizational performance. High pay disparities betweenCEOs and other senior executives can undermine collaboration and teamwork. High levels of CEO pay can alsonegatively affect the morale and productivity of employees who are not senior executives. According to a recent MSCIstudy, labor productivity as measured by sales per employee was lower for companies with higher pay gaps. (SamuelBlock, Income Inequality and the Intracorporate Pay Gap, MSCI, April 2016).We believe that shareholders have expressed concern about our Company's high levels of CEO pay. Only 56 percent ofshareholders voted in favor of Company's advisory vote on executive compensation at the 2019 annual meeting. TheCompany's disclosed CEO to median employee pay ratio increased from 403 to 1 in 2017 to 489 to 1 in 2018. Thedisclosed annual total compensation of the Company's median employee fell from $42,893 in 2017 to $30,639 in 2018.For those reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of this proposal.\\n\",\n",

       " \"National Healthcare Corporation has no women on its Board of Directors. Corporate leaders recognize the strong business case for broader board diversity. The Guiding Principles of Corporate Governance of the Business Roundtable, state: Diverse backgrounds and experiences on corporate boards, including those of directors who represent the broad range of society, strengthen board performance and promote the creation of long-term shareholder value. Boards should develop a framework for identifying appropriately diverse candidates that allows the nominating/corporate governance committee to consider women, minorities and others with diverse backgrounds as candidates for each open board seat. Benefits associated with board diversity include a larger candidate pool from which to pick top talent, better understanding of consumer preferences, a stronger mix of leadership skills, and improved risk management. Despite recent progress, particularly among the largest companies, women and people of color remain significantly underrepresented on U.S. corporate boards. 20 percent of companies in the Russell 3000 have all male boards. Excluding S&P 500 companies, women account for just 19 percent of the directorships in the Russell 3000. And, among board members of Russell 3000 companies whose race was identified, non-white directors represent less than 11 percent. Numerous institutional investors believe that diversity on boards is an indicator of good corporate governance. Public pension plans from Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island have adopted proxy voting policies with minimum board diversity thresholds, resulting in votes against thousands of directors cumulatively. Proxy Insight, a leading source on global voting practices, reported that 60% of U.S. institutional investor proxy voting policy changes in 2018 related to board diversity. For example, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, published updated responsible investment guidelines stating, we would normally expect to see at least two women directors on every board.Legislation mandating board diversity has arrived in the U.S. California legislation enacted in 2018 mandates gender diversity on boards of companies with principal executive offices in that state.

Setting long-term goals for increased use of clean energy and other GHG-reducing measures could serve as a practical step toward aligning Newmont with global efforts to limit climate change insulating our company from regulatory uncertainty, and positioning Newmont as contributing to climate solutions, producing reputational benefits.\\nNewmont\\'s sustainability report notes laudable initiatives related to clean energy, but lacks long\\xad term public goals for reducing GHG emissions through clean energy usage. As such, the company lags many peers. 3M, Dalmia Cement, GM, Kingspan, and Tata Motors are among the over 200 leading global companies who have publicly committed to I 00% renewables.\\nClean energy is a practical tool to reduce GHG emissions that could also benefit Newmont\\'s bottom line. Nationally, the US Energy Information Association reports the average cost of electricity is $0.11/k:Wh for commercial customers in 2019. By contrast, Bloomberg New Energy Finance\\'s 2018 Sustainable Energy in America Factbookreports \"the most competitive power purchase agreements (PPAs) came in at just over [$0.02/k:Wh] for solar, while wind PPAs ... averaged an estimated [$0.017/k:Wh] in 2017.\" Likewise, a 2018 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found the cost of saved energy for commercial and industrial customers in states with utility-funded efficiency programs was $0.028/k:Wh. This business case is stronger still in the many remote locations where the company operates.\\nAccordingly, we urge Newmont to report on if, and how, it will adopt long-term clean energy sourcing goals.\\n',\n",

       " \"Noble Energy’s offshore natural gas operations in Israel represented 43 percent of its known reserves as of year-end 2018. These projects have generated intense controversy. The Tamar platform’s staggering emission and pollution rate, and the decision to relocate Leviathan’s production platform from 70 miles offshore to just six miles offshore has triggered lawsuits, scientific condemnation, opposition from more than 20 local and regional governments, and the largest health and environmental protests in Israel’s history.\\n\\nEnvironmental, health and financial risks include:\\nAIR POLLUTION\\nA 2016 Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) report stated that Noble’s Tamar natural gas operations produced 30x more emissions than originally estimated and emitted 51 percent of Israel’s carcinogenic benzene between 2013-2018.\\nLeviathan is projected to produce more gas and condensate than Tamar. Leviathan’s new Flare Gas Recovery Unit, used to reduce emissions, has not yet been deployed on gas processing platforms before, which raises questions about how well it will perform in practice. In 2018 MoEP rejected the Leviathan Production Platform permit application stating they had “serious doubts regarding the reliability of all of the information” in the application.\\n\\xa0\\nWATER POLLUTION\\nThe Leviathan Production Platform will release approximately 800 tons of produced water into the sea daily, potentially impacting marine life and public beaches.\\xa0A water leak in Leviathan 2 took 16 months to repair and cost $60 million.\\xa0Spill simulations and international experts concur there is little chance of containing a condensate or gas spill this close to shore.\\n\\nCONDENSATE\\xa0\\nCondensate is a liquid by-product of natural gas drilling that is volatile, flammable and highly toxic.\\xa0Leviathan will annually produce approximately 1 million barrels of condensate.\\xa0A condensate spill would likely cause the closure of the nearby Hadera desalination plant that supplies 15 percent of Israel's clean water. The condensate pipeline runs above groundwater sources and will be stored in highly dense population centers. In 2015 Noble and the EPA agreed to a $75 million settlement regarding emission leaks at its condensate storage tanks.\\n\\nSECURITY\\nHezbollah has threatened to attack Israel’s natural gas operations and numerous security experts including a former Israeli Minister of Defense have criticized the near-shore Leviathan platform as an easy target within Hezbollah’s missile range.\\n\\nHEALTH\\nNo comprehensive health impact assessment was done for the Leviathan Production Platform despite it being near population centers including Haifa, Israel’s third largest city.\\xa0\\nWe believe the above issues pose significant reputational, regulatory, legal and financial risk to the company and its shareholders. Noble’s 2018 10K states: “The insurance we carry is insufficient to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.”\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Noble Energy publish a report regarding the extent of potential environmental and public health impacts in the event of major spills or breaches at its operations including an assessment of the magnitude of related financial, operational and reputational impacts on our Company.

It is essential to conduct human rights impact assessments to evaluate and mitigate associated human rights risks.In 2018, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $95 million USG contract to develop the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) database, which is expected to hold biometric data for 260 million people.2 This presents concerns regarding algorithmic racial bias, risks to privacy and First Amendment rights, and potential harm to immigrant communities. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed alarm regarding the potential use of lethal autonomous robotics for targeted killings by states, including Northrop Grumman's X-47B drone.3 Conflict-affected areas are characterized by widespread human rights abuses, and the UNGPs encourage business enterprises operating in those contexts to conduct enhanced due diligence to ensure that the business is not involved with such abuses.4 Northrop Grumman has contracts with or supplies weapons to multiple states engaged in international and internal armed conflicts, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Yemen), India (Kashmir), Israel (Palestine), Morocco (Western Sahara), and Colombia.5 Northrop Grumman is one of Saudi Arabia's largest defense partners and has, been heavily involved in the training and development of Saudi military personnel.6 In 2018, the International Commission of Jurists reported that the Saudi-led coalition violated international humanitarian law during operations in Yemen in 2017.7 The UN declared that the conflict created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people dependent on aid and protection.Northrop Grumman adopted a Human Rights Policy in 2013, but does not disclose its salient human rights issues or how the policy is implemented to prevent, mitigate, or remediate adverse human rights impacts associated with its government contracts. In 2019, 31% of shareholders voted in favor of increased reporting on the implementation of the company's Human Rights Policy.8 Yet, investors are still unable to assess how it evaluates and mitigates risks accompanying specific activities such as weapons contracts, military training, biometrics, and emerging technologies, or with governments engaged in conflict.\\n\",\n",

Litigation can eat into thin margins and cause reputational damage; The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has established sector-specific standards to assist companies in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability information to investors. The standards identify a minimum set of sustainability issues most likely to impact operating performance or financial condition of the typical company in an industry.

Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in one-year including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic won 36%-support at our 2016 annual meeting which is significant. However in 2016 this situation probably did not exist: Both our Chairman, David O'Reilly, and our Lead Director, Jay Burchfield, received 6-times as many negative votes each in 2019 as 2 other directors. Plus David O'Reilly had 47-years long tenure and Jay Burchfield had 22-years long-tenure. Long-tenure in a director is the opposite of independence and independence can be the most important attribute for a director especially a Chairman or a Lead Director. In 2019 shareholders rejected management's advice and gave 51 %-support to a shareholder proposal to make calling a special meeting more accessible to shareholders. This 51 % support probably represents more than 55% support from shareholders who have access to independent proxy voting advice. Management should take into consideration that many shareholders lack access to independent proxy voting advice and thus 51 % support is truly impressive. Plus the 2019 O'Reilly proxy said that O'Reilly is committed to stockholder engagement. Apparently the O'Reilly stockholder engagement did not foresee the 51 %-vote. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company.\\n\",\n",

       " 'The climate-related risks and opportunities that oil and gas companies and their shareholders face in the wake of a shift towards a net-zero GHG emissions economy have been put on full display due to recent global events. In the midst of unprecedented economic uncertainty, something that has become increasingly clear is that these risks and opportunities are likely to intensify as a result of factors such as increasing climate-related policies, shifting market demand, and technological innovation and development.\\nTo manage and adapt to these risks, the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released a set of recommendations that have received wide support from companies, governments and investors alike. Included in these recommendations is that companies should disclose climate-related targets, widely recognized as an important means of assuring investors that climate-related risks are being appropriately managed and mitigated.[1]\\nOvintiv Inc., a leading oil and gas producer in North America, has not made clear how it plans to reduce its emissions and manage its climate-related risks in an increasingly carbon-constrained environment. Unlike many of its peers, Ovintiv has not disclosed any climate-related targets, resulting in uncertainty for investors about how climate-related risks are being managed.\\nThe proposal filed by the Pension Plan of the United Church of Canada, supported by the Shareholder Association for Research & Education (SHARE) seeks information about Ovintiv’s climate-related targets:\\n\\nResolved:\\nThat Ovintiv Inc. (“Ovintiv”) disclose climate-related targets that are aligned with the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. These targets should address Ovintiv’s key climate-related risks and opportunities over medium and long-term time horizons.\\xa0Such targets should be quantitative, subject to regular review, and progress against such targets should be reported to shareholders on an annual basis.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAs one of the largest natural gas producers in North America, it is important for Ovintiv to clarify its plans to transition to a low-carbon future and how it is progressing against this objective through clear, consistent and comprehensive disclosure.\\nIn contrast to many of Ovintiv’s direct peers in the oil and gas sector, Ovintiv has yet to disclose any climate-related targets and does not appear to have plans to do so in the near-term. While Ovintiv has suggested that requesting it disclose climate related-targets is ‘unduly demanding’, many oil and gas companies have disclosed climate-related targets. A recent review indicated that the majority of the world’s top 25 energy companies have disclosed their climate-related targets and performance against those targets[2].\\nIn response to the proposal, the company states that “climate-related considerations are integrated into key planning and risk management processes”; however, without quantitative emissions reduction goals and targets, the company’s disclosures lack a crucial component of the TCFD recommendations on climate-risk management.\\xa0Specifically, the company’s current disclosures on GHG emissions provide little information for shareholders about its anticipated GHG emissions trajectory going forward.\\nThe company also refers to industry-wide emissions reduction targets under the Alberta Climate Leadership Plan and Canada’s emissions reduction targets[3]. We believe the company needs to increase its transparency around its intended contribution to meeting those targets as well as its intended plans for reducing GHG emissions from its operations across all jurisdictions.\\nWhile Ovintiv states in a general sense that it is committed to reducing its emissions, the complete absence of any specific climate-related target inserts uncertainty into investor understanding of the company’s climate strategy and efforts, and causes shareholders to question whether the company is taking the necessary and appropriate steps to address its climate related risks in a timely fashion.\\n',\n",

Best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.\\nResolved:\\xa0Resolved: Shareholders request Pfizer report on the company's global median gender pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information.\\nSupporting Statement:Assessing if a company has a gender pay gap requires analyzing both equal pay and equal opportunity. This is most commonly done using adjusted and unadjusted (median) pay data. Median pay data is the key metric used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Economic Forum, and the U.S Department of Labor, among others. The 2017 U.S. Census data on median earnings for full-time, year-round workers found that women made 80 percent of that of their male counterparts. The gap for African American and Latina women is 61 percent and 53 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059. Since 2018 the United Kingdom has required large businesses to provide disclosure of both adjusted and unadjusted (median) gender pay data. The 2019 Pfizer U.K. Gender Pay Gap Report showed a 15.9 percent median pay gap (up from 14.5 percent in 2018) and a 29.8 percent median bonus pay gap (up from 24.8 percent in 2018). Women comprised 55.6 percent of the lower quartile of its employees but only 37.8 percent of the upper quartile. In 2019, shareholders withdrew a Report on Gender Pay Gap resolution when Pfizer agreed to: to determine whether and to what extent Pfizer has a global gender pay gap and a U.S race pay gap, on both an unadjusted and an adjusted basis. Yet, Pfizer's gender pay gap statement of October 17, 2019 fails to provide any unadjusted (median pay) data. The Pfizer statement reports women earn 99+ percent of the compensation received by men on a statistically adjusted equal pay basis (although this adjusted data excludes Pfizer's executive leadership team and other employee groups). Pfizer's statistically adjusted number alone fails to consider how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. In contrast, median pay gap disclosures address the structural bias that affects the jobs women hold, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs.\\n\",\n",

Pfizer's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of management's and the Board's decision-making process and oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above. For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Pfizer is a member. Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. The report shall be presented to the Corporate Governance Committee and posted on Pfizer's website.\\nSupporting Statement:Pfizer spent $97,570,650 from 2010 through 2018 on federal lobbying. This figure does not include state lobbying, where Pfizer lobbies in all 50 states but disclosure is uneven or absent. Pfizer also lobbies abroad, spending between 800,000-899,000 on lobbying in Europe for 2017. Pfizer sits on the boards of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which together have spent over $1.9 billion on lobbying since 1998. Pfizer does not disclose its payments to trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. And Pfizer does not disclose its membership in tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as belonging to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Though Pfizer uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, it fails to report any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions under GRI Standard 415, giving further indication that the company's disclosures are currently inadequate. We are concerned that Pfizer's lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, media outlets like CNN have highlighted Pfizer's claims to support policies that lower the cost of medicines, while funding PhRMA's opposition to initiatives aimed at lowering drug prices,1 and the Washington Post has called Pfizer's ALEC membership its dirty little secret.2 We believe the reputational damage stemming from this misalignment between general policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by Pfizer. Thus, we urge Pfizer to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",
       " 'nvestors are concerned about the financial, health, environmental, and reputational risks associated with operating and building-out new chemical plants and related infrastructure in Gulf Coast locations increasingly prone to catastrophic storms and flooding associated with climate change. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem), owned jointly by Phillips 66 and Chevron, is a major petrochemical producer in the Gulf Coast.\\n\\nPetrochemical facilities like ethane crackers and polyethylene processing plants produce dangerous pollutants including benzene (a known carcinogen), Volatile Organic Compounds, and sulfur dioxide. These operations can become inundated and pose significant chemical release risks during extreme weather events. Flooding from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 resulted in CPChem plant shut downs and the release of unpermitted, unsafe levels of pollutants. Nearby Houston residents reported respiratory and other health problems following CPChem’s releases during Hurricane Harvey.\\xa0\\n\\nGrowing storms and the costs they bring our company are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as global warming escalates. Recent reports show that greenhouse gas emissions throughout the petrochemical and plastic supply chain contribute significantly to climate change, exacerbating the threat of physical risks such as storms. Flood-related damage is projected to be highest in Texas, where many of CPChem’s petrochemical plants are concentrated, and Houston alone has seen three 500-year floods in a three-year span. Phillips 66 cited Hurricane Harvey as a major reason for a $123 million decrease in pre-tax income from its chemicals segment in 2017.\\n\\nCivil society groups have mobilized to oppose the expansion of petrochemical facilities in their communities due to concerns regarding direct health and livelihood impacts from air and water pollutant releases. Such opposition threatens to jeopardize CPChem’s social license to operate in the region. Historically, releases from CPChem’s petrochemical operations have exceeded legal limits, exposing the company to liability. As climate change intensifies flooding and storm strength, the potential for unplanned chemical releases grows.\\xa0\\n\\nIn spite of these risks, CPChem has accelerated its petrochemical activity in the Gulf Coast, investing heavily to expand in flood-prone areas of Texas. The company has generally disclosed that physical climate-related risks may impact its business and that it has a risk management system to plan for resiliency. The impacts to CPChem’s operations from Hurricane Harvey, however, indicate the company’s level of preparedness is insufficient. While the Company rapidly expands its petrochemical assets in climate-impacted areas, investors seek improved disclosure to understand whether CPChem is adequately evaluating and mitigating public health risks associated with climate-related impacts and the dangerous chemicals it uses.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Phillips 66 with board oversight publish a report omitting proprietary information and prepared at reasonable cost assessing the public health risks of expanding petrochemical operations and investments in areas increasingly prone to climate change induced storms flooding and sea level rise.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nInvestors request the company assess, among other related issues at management and Board discretion: The adequacy of measures the company is employing to prevent public health impacts from associated chemical releases.\\n',\n",

Industrial meat production exposes workers, farmers, and communities to actual and potential adverse human rights impacts. Poultry processing workers face serious labor rights violations, including injuries from unsafe line speeds and other hazards, exposure to toxins, wage and hour violations, sexual harassment, and workplace discrimination.1 2 Factory farming contributes to economic struggles for contract growers and family farmers, exploitation of migrant farmworkers, and occupational health and safety risks. Monoculture farming to grow animal feed requires heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, impacting human health, soil and water quality.Pilgrim Pride's faces public resistance to the expansion of its operations and footprint to meet growing demand for protein. In 2018, community members spoke up in opposition to a proposed plant in Georgia due to concerns about negative impact to the local community and environment.3 A proactive assessment of Pilgrim Pride's salient human rights risks, informed by meaningful stakeholder consultation, would mitigate adverse human rights impacts and threats to the company's social license to operate and business opportunities.Recent legal complaints against Pilgrim's Pride and its subsidiaries range from allegations of hiring discrimination,4 5 disability discrimination,6 to federal fines issued for violations of: environmental; wage and hour; workplace safety and health; and labor relations regulations.7 The repeated occurrence of these types of fines and lawsuits indicate that although Pilgrim Pride's commits to respect human rights in its Code of Conduct and Sustainability Report documents, adoption of corporate principles is only the first step in effectively managing human rights risks.Corporations have a responsibility to respect human rights within company-owned operations and through business relationships under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.8 To meet this responsibility, companies are expected to conduct HRDD, informed by the core international human rights instruments, to assess, identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts.9 To protect its long-term financial interest, Pilgrim's Pride should do just that.\\n\",\n",

Animal waste from over 5,300 poultry farms3 may contain nutrients, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and pathogens. These contaminants and poor manure disposal practices pollute local waterways, endangering public health, workers, and the environment. At the same time, there is a growing trend toward increased state regulation and oversight of pollution from the meat industry. Pilgrim’s notes that its feed mills are “strategically located in the areas where we have processing operations.”4 Several states where Pilgrim’s has processing operations5 have tightened requirements related to nutrient management plans, manure disposal, field application of manure, and groundwater monitoring for animal agriculture.6\\n\\nPilgrim's competitors are working to reduce supply chain pollution: Smithfield met its target to purchase 75% of its grain from farms managed to reduce water pollution; Perdue has invested $80 million in a poultry litter recycling operation to prevent nutrient pollution; Hormel adopted a sustainable agriculture policy addressing fertilizer and manure management; and Tyson committed to support improved fertilizer practices on two million acres of corn by the end of 2020.

Given the replacement options already offered by PNM, and its current significant reliance on gas-fired generation, it is likely that natural gas-fired plants will continue to play a prominent role in PNM\\'s generation mix.\\nThe energy sector has a critical role to play in mitigating climate risk. The sector at large is transitioning away from coal, but a growing reliance on natural gas creates its own ongoing risk. Natural gas is a major contributor to climate change due to combustion emissions and methane leaks. In 2018, gas contributed to an increase in power sector emissions, jeopardizing chances of achieving reductions in line with the Paris Agreement\\'s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\nBuilding new gas infrastructure may become uneconomic and result in costly stranded assets comparable to early retirements now occurring nationwide for coal, especially considering the rapid, and accelerating, pace of technological innovation. Coal generation went from viable alternative to stranded asset in only a few short years, and the tempo of change has only increased. Demand response, energy efficiency, and renewables plus storage are all increasingly efficient and economically competitive means of serving energy needs while reducing fossil fuel use and climate impacts.\\nWhile PNM is to be commended for its decision to abandon SJGS in 2022 and for its public embrace of the new Renewable Portfolio Standards included in the recently passed New Mexico Energy Transition Act, investors lack sufficient information to assess whether PNM has paid sufficient attention to the risks inherent in substantial investment in natural-gas-fired generation and how these costly assets and their depreciation timelines reconcile with climate stability goals or the existence of increasingly low cost, clean energy pathways.\\nPeer utilities, including NextEra and Xcel, have demonstrated alternatives to investing in natural gas by replacing coal assets with renewables and storage, creating win-win solutions. Shareholders are concerned that PNM may lag behind on such opportunities and increase its exposure to climate-related risks by investing in significant gas-fired infrastructure that may become stranded.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that PNM issue a report describing how it is responding to the risk of stranded assets of natural gas-based infrastructure as the global response to climate change intensifies.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data indicates the amount of plastics recycled fell from 9.1% to 8.4% from 2015 to 2017; a drop in tonnage of nearly 6%. Less than 30% of in-demand plastic PET bottles and less than 50% of highly valuable aluminum cans are recycled annually.\\xa0Is lack of advanced optical scanners and other state of the art sorting equipment at company recycling facilities a factor in declining recovery rates? How does the operating efficiency of our facilities compare with competitors? Extraordinary, unprecedented efforts are needed to develop new materials processing markets; what is the company doing to show leadership in this area?\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board of Directors of Republic Services issue a report at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information discussing how the Company can increase the scale and pace of its efforts to increase plastics recovery and recycling to address environmental problems caused by plastic pollution.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn the report, shareholders suggest discussion of regional market and technical capacities for materials recovery and recycling of plastics, and any public policy, technical or collaborative opportunities to upgrade those conditions and capacities to increase plastics recovery and recycling.\\n\",\n",
       " \"RESOLVED:That the board of directors report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on actions the company is taking to ensure decent work practices are upheld in the company's franchisee operations, including: RBI's minimum requirements and standards related to workforce practices (including wages and benefits, working hours and breaks, health and safety, shift scheduling and training) for corporate offices, branded operations and franchisees; RBI's programs, activities and financial or operational arrangements to support franchisees in adopting best practices for workforce management; and Systems and key performance indicators used by RBI to evaluate whether its minimum requirements and standards are being upheld in its own and franchisee operations.\\nSupporting Statement:In 2019, the same proposal, filed by the Atkinson Foundation, received a majority vote of independent shareholders. In spite of clearly demonstrated shareholder concern regarding decent work practices in the company's franchisee operations, the company has not yet provided any of the information requested in the proposal or made any commitment to address these issues.There is broad consensus that good human capital management is important to the bottom line, especially in customer-facing service industries where an employee's conduct and efficiency are critical to the customer experience. A large body of empirical studies shows that skillful management of human capital is associated with better corporate performance including lower employee turnover, higher productivity and innovation, and better risk mitigation.The widely-publicized response by some Canadian Tim Hortons' franchisees to Ontario's minimum wage increase in January 2018 (e.g., clawing back of other employee benefits), as well as related conflicts with Tim Hortons' franchisee operators over the past few years, and reports from Burger King and Tim Hortons' employees of on-call shift scheduling and unpaid overtime, suggest that workforce management questions are contributing to reputation problems for the Tim Hortons' brand which may affect sales.Restaurant Brands International has noted that decisions by certain franchisees to cut employee benefits, do not reflect the values of our brand, the views of our company or the views of the overwhelming majority of . . . restaurant owners and that ... we are committed to helping them work through these changes. We are requesting a report on that process.Within a franchise operating model, the success and reputation of Restaurant Brands International's business depends on a highly-engaged customer-facing workforce and strong franchisor-franchisee relationships. While franchisees have a direct employment relationship and related responsibilities for the workforce, RBI is responsible for providing both standards and expectations of human capital management, and the collaboration required to uphold strong workplace standards including supportive training, development, and appropriate financial arrangements.Establishing minimum requirements and standards for RBI branded operations and franchisees to ensure decent work, and supporting franchisee capacity to provide decent work, would help RBI to ensure that its direct and franchisee workforce is protected. Ultimately, these steps would also help to ensure that the conditions are in place to deliver high levels of customer service and productivity across all RBI operations.\\n\",\n",

The ocean contains 150 million tons of plastic, with up to 12 million tons added annually, equivalent to a garbage truck load every minute. Experts predict there will be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050. In the marine environment, plastic straws, cups, and lids break down into small indigestible particles that birds and marine animals mistake for food, resulting in illness and death. Packaging that degrades in waterways can also transfer hazardous chemicals to animals and potentially to humans.\\xa0\\n\\nFast food plastic straws, cups, and lids are prevalent in street and marine litter. They are among the top 10 items found in beach cleanups. Americans and Canadians use 550 million plastic straws daily, which are not recycled and can harm marine animals. Tim Hortons was cited as the second largest Canadian plastic polluter in Greenpeace Canada’s 2018 and 2019 beach cleanup brand audits.\\xa0\\n\\nThe company does not disclose the extent to which paper and plastic cups are collected and recycled at its brands. Most of the billions of cups our company uses every year end up in landfills. A Canadian media investigation found that significant amounts of Tim Hortons cups collected for recycling ended up in the trash.\\xa0Our company lags competitors.\\xa0Starbucks has a specific goal for reusable coffee container usage, recycles plastic and paper cups left in stores, set a deadline for phase out of plastic straws, and uses 10% recycled paper cup fiber. Blue Bottle Coffee plans to phase out all single use beverage cups by the end of 2020. Our brands lack any of these commitments.\\xa0\\n\\nBurger King has locations in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, countries suffering some of the worst impacts of the plastic pollution crisis.\\xa0The company is vulnerable to environmental impacts of business expansion in markets lacking waste management capacity.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the company issue a report to shareholders to be prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information to develop environmental leadership commitments on plastic pollution and recycling through a comprehensive policy on sustainable packaging.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponent believes the company should evaluate and report on policies and metrics relative to the company’s performance, such as: recycled content and container recycling goals, adopting reusable/refillable beverage mug programs, ensuring that single-use cups collected actually get recycled, eliminating non-recyclables such as plastic straws and polystyrene foam, and plans to recycle or compost packaging waste at company restaurants.

This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement As long-term shareholders of Royal Caribbean, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates. Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, [D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages. While Royal Caribbean publicly discloses a policy on corporate political spending, we believe it is deficient because the company does not disclose any of its election-related spending from corporate funds. Publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, both direct and indirect, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations that is used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of peer companies, including Darden Restaurants Inc., Starbucks Corp., and Walt Disney Co., which present this information on their websites. The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.\\n\",\n",

Therefore, oil and gas companies need the support of their shareholders to change course: first, to align their targets with the Paris Climate Agreement, and second, to invest accordingly in the energy transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.\\n\\nFiduciary duty\\nWe, the shareholders, understand this support to be part of our fiduciary duty. A growing international consensus has emerged among financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore achieving the goals of Paris is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy. Institutional investors foresee that they cannot make a decent return on capital in a world economy disrupted by devastating climate change.\\n\\nScope 3\\nReducing absolute emissions from the use of energy products (Scope 3) is crucial to achieving the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, and we therefore support you to include these in your targets. This climate targets resolution reflects our belief that we need targets for all emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) that are truly aligned with a well-below-2°C pathway across the whole energy sector.\\n\\nEmissions reductions\\nThe goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, to aim for a global net-zero emissions energy system, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.\\n• 2°C: the median pathway of the IPCC Lower-2°C pathway group (*) suggests an absolute emissions reduction of CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (net) of approximately 70% by 2050, relative to 2016.\\n• 1.5°C: in 2018, the IPCC emphasized that climate-related risks are significantly higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C, and that limiting warming to 1.5°C would require CO2 emissions to reach net zero by 2050. (**)\\nAccording to these IPCC pathways: to reach the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, absolute net energy- related emissions should be reduced by approximately 70% (2°C) to 100% (1.5°C) by 2050, relative to 2016.\\n\\n(*) 54 pathways limiting peak warming to below 2°C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66% likelihood (IPCC special report Global Warming of 1.5ºC, 2018)\\n(**) IPCC special report Global Warming of 1.5ºC, 2018\\n\\nClimate targets\\nIn 2017, following significant shareholder support for a similar climate targets resolution, Royal Dutch Shell plc made an industry-leading statement by including Scope 3 in their ambition to halve the carbon intensity of their energy products by 2050.\\n\\nHowever, halving the carbon intensity in a growing energy system will not lead to a level of absolute emissions reduction necessary to actually achieve the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, and is therefore not on a well-below-2°C pathway.\\n\\nMoreover, this ambition has not resulted in an adequate change in investments beyond oil and gas. On the contrary – according to consultancy Rystad Energy – Shell’s medium-term investments aim to increase oil and gas production by 38% by 2030.\\n\\nTherefore, this resolution reflects our belief that every fossil fuel company needs visible and unambiguous shareholder support to (1) truly align its targets with the Paris Climate Agreement and (2) invest accordingly.\\n\\nWe believe that the company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels compatible with the global intergovernmental consensus specified by the Paris Climate Agreement.\\n\\nYou have our support.\\n',\n",

Industrial meat production exposes workers, farmers, and communities to actual and potential adverse human rights impacts. Poultry processing workers face serious labor rights violations, including injuries from unsafe line speeds and other hazards, exposure to toxins, wage and hour violations, sexual harassment, and workplace discrimination.1 Factory farming contributes to economic struggles for contract growers and family farmers, exploitation of migrant farmworkers, and occupational health and safety risks. Monoculture farming to grow animal feed requires heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, impacting human health, soil and water quality, and biodiversity.Increased public scrutiny on these harmful production practices generates significant financial risk. The poultry processing industry is plagued by legal complaints, fines, and journalist investigations2 revealing patterns of workplace violations. Sanderson Farms is not immune: allegations against the company and its subsidiaries range from denied disability accommodation3 to federal fines issued for violations of wage and hour regulations,4 workplace safety and health, and labor relation regulations.5 In addition, lacking proper HRDD processes that include stakeholder consultation sparks public resistance to expanding operations. In 2018, community members in East Texas opposed a new Sanderson Farms development due to concerns about negative impact to the local community and environment.6 A proactive assessment of the salient human rights risks, informed by meaningful stakeholder consultation, would mitigate adverse human rights impacts and threats to the company's social license to operate. Though Sanderson Farms' Corporate Sustainability Statement affirms that a sustainable future is only possible if the interests of all stakeholders are considered,7 the repeated occurrence of these types of investigations, fines, and lawsuits indicates that broader steps need be taken to ensure that the company upholds these values.Corporations have a responsibility to respect human rights within company-owned operations and through business relationships under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.8 To meet this responsibility, companies are expected to conduct HRDD, informed by the core international human rights instruments, to assess, identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts.9 To protect its long-term financial interest, Sanderson Farms should do just that.\\n\",\n",

The report shall be prepared at reasonable cost omitting proprietary information and shall be made available on the Company's website no later than the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.\\nSupporting Statement:The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the ECOA'') was enacted in 1974 to prohibit racial discrimination in all forms of lending, including vehicle lending. However, the longstanding problem of racial discrimination in vehicle lending remains a significant policy issue.According to the Center for Responsible Lending, auto dealership interest rate markups on vehicle loans have resulted in racial disparities for African American and Latino borrowers compared to similarly situated white borrowers. A dealer interest rate markup is the practice of adding additional interest to a vehicle loan that is not related to a borrower's creditworthiness. Borrowers of color are more likely to be charged dealer interest rate markups. (Delvin Davis and Chris Kukla, Road to Nowhere: Car Dealer Interest Rate Markups Lead to Higher Interest Rates, Not Discounts, November 2015; Delvin Davis, Non-Negotiable: Negotiation Doesn't Help African Americans and Latinos on Dealer-Financed Car Loans, January 2014)The issue of racial discrimination in vehicle lending is significantly related to our Company's business because our Company is an indirect vehicle lender through auto dealerships. Indirect vehicle lending by our Company and other financing companies has been subject to scrutiny by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018:The CFPB has conducted in the past, and continues to conduct, supervisory audits of large providers of vehicle financing, including us, with respect to possible ECOA disparate impact credit discrimination in indirect vehicle finance and other related matters. The CFPB and the DOJ have continued to enter into consent orders, memoranda of understanding and settlements with multiple lenders pertaining to allegations of disparate impact regarding vehicle dealer markups, requiring consumer financing companies, including us, to revise their pricing and compensation systems to substantially reduce dealer discretion and other financial incentives to mark up interest rates and to pay restitution to borrowers as well as fines and penalties.In 2019, Institutional Shareholder Services recommended a vote for this proposal at our Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, noting that:Santander could, however, provide additional context about the requirements of its Enterprise Fair Lending Policy and its implementation. Additionally, the company could disclose how it manages risk for both its direct and indirect lending businesses as well as provide an overview of its efforts relating to preventing discrimination in vehicle lending at auto dealerships.For these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR the proposal.\\n\",\n",

Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by Southwest used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. Southwest's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of management's and the Board's decision-making process and oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above.For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbing communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Southwest is a member.Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on Southwest's website.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting StatementWe encourage transparency and accountability in Southwest's use of funds to lobby. Southwest spent $11,230,000 from 2010 - 2018 on federal lobbying. These figures do not include state lobbying expenditures, where Southwest also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Southwest spent $483,855 on lobbying in California from 2010 - 2018. And Southwest's previous aggressive lobbying campaign against high speed rail in Texas reportedly killed the project by persuading two crucial officials.1Southwest serves on the board of Airlines for America (A4A), which spent $15,133,100 on lobbying for 2017 and 2018.2 A4A's lobbying over passenger facility charges3 and against Massachusetts sick leave law4 has attracted media attention. Southwest does not comprehensively disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. And Southwest does not disclose its payments to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).We are concerned that Southwest's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks. For example, Southwest's recent ALEC sponsorship has drawn scrutiny,5 and over 110 companies have publicly left ALEC. Southwest uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, yet fails to report any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions under GRI Standard 415. As shareholders, we believe that companies should ensure there is alignment between their own positions and their lobbying, including through trade associations. We urge Southwest to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",

Plastic beverage containers are among the most common items found in beach cleanups. One-half of Starbucks drinks are now cold drinks, most served in plastic cups, with no reported recycled content. Plastics degrade in water to small particles that animals mistake for food; plastic pollution impacts 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation, and drowning. Former UN Undersecretary-General Erik Solheim called the issue “an ocean Armageddon.”\\nAs Starbucks and peers have fostered a wasteful “to go” disposable coffee cup culture, plastic pollution of land and water has become an urgent environmental issue. Starbucks aspires to reduce the environmental impact from its packaging; however, it has failed to achieve several signature goals, such as cup recycling and serving a quarter of beverages in reusable cups in all operated U.S. and Canada stores. Explosive business growth in China suggests the company’s waste footprint may be expanding instead of shrinking.\\nThe company operates in 75 countries, but has cup recycling goals apparently for only the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks operates 3,300 stores in China and plans to nearly double that to 6,000 by 2022. It opens a new store in China every 15 hours. China has been cited as the leading source of plastic waste in oceans (28%). Starbucks has not reported taking steps to recycle cups in China. Competitor McDonald’s Corp. will recycle packaging at all locations globally by 2025. Lack of similar commitment by Starbucks could lead to backlash by its environmentally aware customer base.\\nThe company failed to attain greatly reduced goals regarding reusable containers, a key step toward reducing environmental impact. Starbucks rescinded a 2008 goal to deliver 25% of beverages in reusables by 2015, then failed to meet a reduced goal of 5%. Estimates of beverages served in reusable cups fell from 1.6% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2018. Starbucks replaced clear reporting on the number of stores recycling cups with a vague goal to double recyclability of cups, raising questions about the status of these signature initiatives.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors of Starbucks issue a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on reducing the company’s environmental impacts by stepping up the scale and pace of its sustainable packaging initiatives.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nProponent believes that the Board should evaluate and report on the potential for fulfilling the company’s environmental impact leadership commitments and goals toward reducing ocean pollution, including more detailed disclosure of any trends, policies and metrics on issues such as:\\nProgress toward recycling cups in operations, worldwide,\\nAssessing the environmental impact of business expansion in markets lacking recycling and waste management capacity,\\nDisclosing how many cups collected in stores are actually recycled,\\nProgress towards a significantly increased reusable container goal, and\\nProgress toward using recycled content in plastic cups.\\n',\n",

       " 'Whereas:\\nStryker seeks to improve healthcare “by working with our customers to make the world better for patients, caregivers, employees and the environment.”\\nIn 2019, Stryker’s CEO signed the Business Roundtable’s “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” joining 180 chief executives who publicly commit to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders—customers, employees, suppliers, communities, the environment and shareholders. To do so, we believe Stryker will require mechanisms that better align executive leadership incentives to goals that account for health impacts on the communities it serves and the environment.\\nIncluding sustainability metrics in executive compensation can create value for all stakeholders, and linking executive pay to performance across sustainability metrics (“CSR contracting”) improves firm value and increases social and environmental initiatives, according to a 2019 study.” Moreover, the paper finds that major companies are increasingly tying sustainability to incentive awards. For example, “While only 12 percent of S&P 500 companies had adopted CSR contracting by 2004, this ratio increased to 37 percent by 2013.” In surveying the S&P Global 1200, the Conference Board found a fivefold increase of companies implementing this practice.\\nCompanies have introduced sustainability metrics into compensation philosophies and methodologies.\\n• At IDEXX Laboratories in 2019, the “preparation and publication of the Company’s first Corporate Responsibility Report” factored into the annual performance-based cash bonus award for top executives.\\n• At Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2019, 30 percent of executive short-term incentive awards were based on non-financial goals, including ‘customer allegiance’ and ‘workforce diversity.’\\n• Walmart Inc.’s, annual incentive awards are contingent on progress in implementing enhancements to its ethics and compliance program. 2019 objectives “covered various subject matters including anti-corruption, health and safety, food safety, environmental compliance, and licensing and permits.”\\n• Herman Miller Inc. states a “key objective[s] of our executive officer compensation program” is to “reinforce our commitment to our people, planet, and communities.”\\nSustainability metrics relate to environmental and public health impacts, among other impacts on stakeholders, and are distinct and vitally important strategic issues for Stryker. In its 2019 proxy, Stryker selects specific compensation performance metrics to further the objectives of its strategic plan. Therefore, we believe the Board should consider incorporating specific sustainability metrics into executive compensation design, as evidence shows their inclusion would incentivize leadership to improve customer relations, reduce risk, enhance financial performance, and increase accountability. The 2019 proxy states, “The Board oversees strategic direction and priorities for the Company…and monitors the Company’s risk, performance and impact on its stakeholders, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) related matters…” making increased executive accountability for sustainability more imperative.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board’s Compensation Committee publish a report (at reasonable expense, within a reasonable time, and omitting confidential or propriety information) assessing the feasibility of integrating specific sustainability metrics into Stryker’s executive compensation program.\\n',\n",

A recent National Institute of Health- supported study2 provides compelling evidence that human exposures to Bisphenol A, for example, ismuch greater than previous estimates that use indirect measurement tools. Bisphenol A affects tissue development linked to behavior, fertility and cancer risks. Approximately 9 million tons annually is used in a variety of consumer products including plastics, epoxy resins and thermal receipts.States have begun restricting hazardous chemicals. Since 2000, more than 35 states have passed 173 policies that establish state chemicals programs to identify, limit or ban the use of harmful chemicals in products including baby bottles, furniture, electronics, toys, cosmetics and cleaning products.3Toxic chemical impacts present systemic portfolio risks to investors. In the last decade, poor management of regulatory, legal, reputation and redesign risks from hazardous chemicals in products and supply chains has harmed investors as confirmed by plummeting company stock prices (Bayer, Lumber Liquidators) and bankruptcy (Siggs, USA).Retailers and manufacturers are demonstrating improvements resulting from comprehensive chemical management policies and practices.4 Walmart, Target, and Dollar Tree have set public goals to address their chemical footprints. In 2018, Target set time-bound goals to remove unwanted chemicals from its textile categories.

(the Company) request that the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation. The Executive Compensation Committee should describe in the Company's proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies with this requested policy. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan.\\nSupporting Statement:SUPPORTING STATEMENT: This proposal encourages the Executive Compensation Committee to consider whether the CEO's compensation is internally aligned with the Company's pay practices for its other employees. Under this proposal, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine how other employees' pay should influence CEO compensation. This proposal does not require the Executive Compensation Committee to use employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks.Like at many companies, our Company's Executive Compensation Committee has used peer group benchmarks of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These target pay amounts are then subject to performance adjustments. To ensure that our Company's CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company's overall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Executive Compensation Committee should also consider the pay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts.Over time, using peer group benchmarks as the primary measure to set CEO compensation targets can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies have targeted their CEO's pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher.High levels of CEO pay relative to other employees may hurt organizational performance. High pay disparities between CEOs and other senior executives can undermine collaboration and teamwork. High levels of CEO pay can also negatively affect the morale and productivity of employees who are not senior executives. According to a 2016 MSCI study, labor productivity as measured by sales per employee was lower for companies with higher pay gaps.Our Company's CEO annual total compensation for fiscal 2019 was $18,822,770. In contrast, the Company's median employee received $11,791 in total compensation in fiscal 2019 resulting in a pay ratio of 1,596:1- which is higher than the reported 1,501:1 ratio in fiscal 2018. Recently, the following companies' pay ratios were: Ross Stores 1,222:1; Starbucks 1,049:1; Macy 582:1; Home Depot 486:1; and Best Buy 610:1.

Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.

United is also a member of The International Air Transport Association, which is believed to be lobbying against regional and global climate regulations.

       " \"Numerous studies suggest companies that integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their business strategy reduce reputational, legal and regulatory risks and improve long-term performance.\\xa0\\nBlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, has noted that “ESG factors relevant to a company's business can provide essential insights into management effectiveness and thus a company's long-term prospects.”\\xa0\\nUnited Airlines Holdings (“United”) has taken steps to address ESG issues and provide public disclosure, including concerning its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the substantial risk that climate change poses to its operations, respect human and worker rights in its operations and supply chain, and prevent human trafficking through employee training. However, United has not explicitly linked sustainability goals with senior executive incentives. Investors seek clarity on how United drives sustainability improvement and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability.\\xa0\\nMany multi-national companies, including Intel, Alcoa, PepsiCo, and Mead Johnson, have integrated sustainability metrics into their executive pay incentive plans. Another prominent example is Royal Dutch Shell, which announced in December 2018 its plans to tie a portion of executive pay to concrete targets linked to the company’s net carbon footprint.\\xa0\\nThe increasing incorporation of sustainability metrics into executive pay evaluative criteria stems from the growing recognition that sustainability strategies can drive growth, as well as enhance profitability and shareholder value.\\xa0\\nThe 2016 Glass Lewis report, In-Depth: Linking Compensation to Sustainability found a “mounting body of research showing that firms that operate in a more responsible manner may perform better financially.... Moreover, these companies were also more likely to tie top executive incentives to sustainability metrics.”\\xa0\\nA Harvard Business School study of S&P 500 executives’ pay packages found a positive relationship between the presence of explicit incentive compensation for corporate social responsibility and firms’ social performance.\\xa0\\nA 2012 guidance issued by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and the UN Global Compact found that including ESG issues “within executive management goals and incentive schemes can be an important factor in the creation and protection of long-term shareholder value.”\\xa0\\nEffectively managing for sustainability offers positive opportunities for companies and should be a key metric by which senior executives are judged. Linking sustainability metrics to executive compensation could reduce risks related to sustainability underperformance, incentivize employees to meet sustainability goals and achieve resultant benefits, and increase accountability. Metrics relevant to United could include indicators related to pressing issues\\xa0\\nsuch as: environmental impacts, energy and fuel efficiency, supply chain human rights and risk management, worker health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and data privacy and security.\\xa0\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board Compensation Committee prepare a report assessing the feasibility of integrating objective sustainability metrics into performance measures, performance goals or vesting conditions that may apply to senior executives under United’s compensation incentive plans. Sustainability is defined as how environmental and social considerations, and related financial impacts, are integrated into corporate strategy over the long term.\\xa0\\n\",\n",

The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.\\xa0\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nAccording to the most recent annual “Emissions Gap Report” issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (November 26, 2019), critical gaps remain between the commitments national governments have made and the actions required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Companies have an important and constructive role to play in enabling policy-makers to close these gaps.\\xa0\\nCorporate lobbying activities that are inconsistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement present regulatory, reputational and legal risks to investors. These efforts also present systemic risks to our economies, as delays in implementation of the Paris Agreement increase the physical risks of climate change, pose a systemic risk to economic stability and introduce uncertainty and volatility into our portfolios. We believe that Paris-aligned climate lobbying helps to mitigate these risks, and contributes positively to the long-term value of our investment portfolios.\\xa0\\nOf particular concern are the trade associations and other politically active organizations that speak for business but, unfortunately, too often present forceful obstacles to progress in addressing the climate crisis.\\xa0\\nAs investors, we view fulfillment of the Paris Agreement’s agreed goal—to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C— as an imperative. We are convinced that unabated climate change will have a devastating impact on our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of their portfolios. We see future “business as usual” scenarios of 3-4°C or greater as both unacceptable and uninvestable.\\xa0\\nWe commend United Airlines for responding to CDP’s annual climate change survey, including information on the company’s direct (in the company’s name) and indirect (through trade associations and other organizations) lobbying efforts related to climate change and their consistency with corporate policy. Two hundred institutional investors managing $6.5 trillion recently wrote to United Airlines, seeking an answer to a different question: How does United Airlines work to ensure that its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with the Paris Agreement’s goals, and what does the company do to address any misalignments it has found?

Both the BRT and NAM are lobbying against shareholder rights to file resolutions. We commend Verizon for now disclosing its significant memberships in trade associations and social welfare organizations, but serious disclosure concerns remain. Verizon does not disclose its payments to trade associations, nor the amounts used for lobbying.We are concerned that Verizon's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risk when it contradicts Verizon's public positions. For example, Verizon states it is committed to an open internet, yet USTelecom is actively fighting against net neutrality.2 CTIA has drawn scrutiny for lobbying against a throttling ban in California.3 Verizon uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, yet currently fails to report any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions under GRI Standard 415.We believe reputational damage stemming from misalignment between policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by Verizon. Thus, we urge Verizon to expand its lobbying disclosure.\\n\",\n",

This proposal does not seek greater disclosure or information regarding cybersecurity (the criminal or unauthorized actions), but rather is focused on legally permissible and permitted uses of data.\\nSupporting Statement:Supporting Statement: According to page 37 of Verizon's 2019 proxy materials, the Verizon Short-Term Plan included adjusted EPS, free cash flow, total revenue, and diversity and sustainability. According to page 41 the Long-Term Plan is focused on total shareholder return, free cash flow, and retention. User privacy and how user data is used are vitally important issues for Verizon and should be included in executive compensation plans, as we believe it would incentivize top leadership to respect user privacy, enhance financial performance, reduce risks, and increase accountability.\\n\",\n",
       " \"we believe in full disclosure of our company's direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether Vertex's lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and in the best interests of shareholders.\\nResolved:\\xa0RESOLVED, the shareholders of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex) request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 1. Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by Vertex used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. Vertex's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of the decision making process and oversight by management and the Board for making payments described in section 2 and 3 above.\\nSupporting Statement:We encourage transparency in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation, both directly and indirectly. Vertex spent over $3 million in 2017 and 2018 on federal lobbying (opensecrets. org). This figure does not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Vertex also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Vertex had 133 lobbyists in 33 states in 2018 (followthemoney.org), and has spent over $290,000 on lobbying in California in 2017-2018. Vertex's lobbying has drawn media attention (Is Big Pharma Getting 'Patient Advocates' to Do Its Lobbying Work? The Daily Beast, April 6, 2018), (Drugmakers Dramatically Boosted Lobbying Spending in Trump's First Quarter, Salon, April 22, 2017). Vertex is listed as a member of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, which spent $19.26 million on lobbying in 2017 and 2018. Vertex does not disclose its trade association memberships, nor payments and the portions used for lobbying. Transparent reporting would reveal whether company assets are being used for objectives contrary to Vertex's long-term interests. We are concerned that Vertex's lack of lobbying disclosures, including lobbying done indirectly by trade associations and other organizations, and any potential negative publicity for opposing drug price initiatives, may present reputational risks for Vertex.\\n\",\n",

Plastic bags are among the most common items found in beach cleanups.\\xa0These lightweight bags can easily become airborne on city streets or in landfills and migrate into waterways, where they cause harm. Plastics bags degrade in water to small particles that animals mistake for food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation, and drowning. Sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. An estimated 100,000 marine animals are killed annually by plastic bags. They have also been found in the stomachs of many land animals including elephants, tigers, zebras, cows, and camels, according to National Geographic.\\nBy 2050 there could be more plastic than fish, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\\xa0Former UN Undersecretary-General Erik Solheim called the issue “an ocean Armageddon.”\\xa0The environmental cost of consumer plastic products and packaging exceeds $139 billion annually, according to the American Chemistry Council.\\nMore than 470 U.S. municipalities in 28 states now ban or charge fees for single-use plastic carry out bags. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Oregon, Hawaii, Maine, New York, and Vermont and more than 50 countries have taken action to ban or restrict plastic bags.

       " \"The World Health Organization deems antibiotic resistance one of the top 10 global health threats of 2019.1 Antibiotic resistance renders life-saving drugs useless; by 2050, the phenomenon could cause an estimated 300 million premature deaths and up to $100 trillion in global economic damage.2The use of antibiotics in animal agriculture is a major contributor to antibiotic resistance.3 Nearly two-thirds of antibiotics sold for use in the U.S. are used in food animals.4 When antibiotics are routinely administered to animals, bacteria can adapt and spread, causing drug-resistant infections in humans.To reduce risks related to antibiotic resistance, meat producers must reduce the routine use of medically important antibiotics in their supply chains. Allowing routine use, even as a preventive measure, creates a greater potential for creating antibiotic resistant superbugs, increasing Walmart's reputational and legal risk.Despite the urgent threat of antibiotic resistance, Walmart does not appear to prohibit the routine use of medically important antibiotics by its meat and poultry suppliers. The company's published position on antibiotic use aligns with current legal requirements, but those requirements are widely regarded by consumer health advocates as insufficient to prevent antibiotic resistance in meat products.5Antibiotic resistant bacteria were recently found in certain of Walmart's pork products, leading to significant negative press.6 Having superbugs in its meat products is a substantial reputational and legal risk for Walmart. Not only will many consumers avoid the store, there is legal liability associated with selling meat products proven to contain superbugs.Walmart announced in April 2019 that it would establish its own supply chain for Angus beef. Beef represents the largest proportion of antibiotics used in food animals (42 percent).7 By sourcing directly from producers, Walmart has a unique opportunity to decrease its risk related to antibiotic resistance in its beef supply.Other major food companies are beginning to address the urgent antibiotic resistance crisis. McDonald's announced a comprehensive policy in 2018 fully disallowing the use of medically important antibiotics for prevention purposes in beef from the top ten countries from which it sources beef. Whole Foods Market has a strict policy to only carry meat products raised without any antibiotics.8 The majority of the top 25 fast food and restaurant chains in the U.S. only serve chicken raised without the routine use of medically important antibiotics.9 In contrast, Walmart's policy does not explicitly prevent suppliers from using medically important antibiotics for disease prevention. Without an explicit prohibition, it is likely that its suppliers are routinely administering medically important antibiotics.\\nResolved:\\xa0Shareholders request that Walmart issue a report, prepared at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information, assessing strategies to strengthen the company's existing supplier antibiotic use standards, such as prohibiting or restricting the routine use of medically important antibiotics by meat and poultry suppliers, and assess the costs and benefits to public health and the company compared to current practice.\\n\",\n",
       " \"This past year, workplace sexual harassment has garnered major attention from elected officials, the media and policy makers, and spurred significant public debate. In June 2019, the International Labor Organization adopted a global treaty to protect workers facing violence and harassment at work.1 In the U.S., over 100 bills related to sexual harassment were introduced in state legislatures in 2019.2 Members of Congress introduced the BE Heard Act to expand protections for vulnerable workers, especially those in low-wage jobs, where research shows sexual harassment is more pronounced.3Workplace sexual harassment can damage companies in several ways. First, it may harm corporate reputation, which can alienate consumers. A 2018 study in Harvard Business Review found that a single sexual harassment claim makes a company seem less equitable, and that sexual harassment, more than financial misconduct, is perceived as evidence of a problematic corporate culture.4 Additionally, a company whose culture tolerates sexual harassment tends to have higher turnover and less productive employees: 80 percent of women who've been harassed leave their jobs within two years.5The Center for American Progress (CAP) found that the retail industry had the second highest incidence of harassment claims in the private sector, representing 13.4 percent of all claims.6 CAP found that women-particularly women of color-are more likely to work lower-wage jobs [like retail], where power imbalances are often more pronounced and where fears of reprisals or losing their jobs can deter victims from coming forward.7Sexual harassment allegations can lead to declines in share value. After the firing of Steve Easterbrook, former McDonald's CEO and former Walmart board member, for inappropriate relations with an employee, attention focused on allegations of sexual harassment8 and a workplace culture enabling such behavior.9 In November, McDonalds' market value went down by $4 billion and shares plummeted to a new low.10Robust board oversight is especially important at Walmart to address ongoing sexual harassment issues. In October 2019, the EEOC filed suit against Walmart stating that from 2014 to 2018 a Walmart employee regularly made unwelcome sexual comments and advances to a female co-worker.11 In 2018, a well-publicized article documented a female associate's struggle to hold her manager accountable for inappropriately touching her.12 Similar harassment complaints, from employees taking inappropriate pictures to discrimination against transgender employees, have been lodged.13As the largest corporate employer of women in the U.S., Walmart can and should be a leader in preventing sexual harassment and holding wrongdoers accountable.We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.\\nResolved:\\xa0Shareholders of Walmart Inc. (Walmart) urge the Board of Directors to strengthen Walmart's prevention of workplace sexual harassment by formalizing the Board's oversight responsibility, aligning senior executive compensation incentives, reviewing (and if necessary overseeing revision of) company policies, and reporting to shareholders by December 31, 2020 on actions taken (omitting confidential and proprietary information).\\n\",\n",

Disney spent $34,055,000 from 2010 - 2018 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where Disney also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Disney spent $3,259,090 on lobbying in California from 2010 - 2018. And Disney also lobbies abroad, spending between €400,000 - €499,000 on lobbying in Europe for 2018.\\xa0\\nDisney serves on the board of NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, which spent $146 million on lobbying from 2010-2018, and belongs to the Chamber of Commerce (“Paris Pullout Pits Chamber against Some of Its Biggest Members,\"\\xa0Bloomberg, June 9, 2017), which has spent over $1.5 billion on lobbying since 1998. Unlike peer group members Accenture, Cisco, Intel and Microsoft, Disney does not disclose memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. We believe Disney should reconsider its resistance to disclosure of its spending on public policy.\\nWe are concerned that Disney\\'s lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when it contradicts company public positions. For example, Disney showed real leadership supporting the Paris Agreement on climate change (“Disney CEO Iger Quits Trump Council over Climate Decision,”\\xa0CNBC, June 2, 2017), yet the Chamber opposed the Paris climate accord. A 2018 report looking at political engagement transparency rated Disney an “F” on responsible lobbying (“Disney, Huawei and EY among Worst Offenders in Disclosing Lobbying,\"\\xa0The Guardian, November 25, 2018).

       " 'Plastic pollution has become a critical and urgent global problem. Experts estimate 300,000 metric tonnes of plastic are polluted to the ocean from U.S. land sources every year. The global figure is eight to twelve million tonnes and is projected to increase rapidly. The environmental impacts of plastic pollution are vast, including significant harm to marine and terrestrial ecosystems and wildlife.\\nPlastic waste breaks down and persists in the environment, eventually accumulating in agricultural soils, water supplies, food supplies, and the human body – with as yet unknown health repercussions.\\nDue to heightened global awareness of the impacts of plastic pollution, restrictions on single-use plastics were implemented in 150 countries and approximately 350 U.S. municipalities through 2018. However, aggressive lobbying by industry and trade associations helped prevent even more laws from taking effect, including container deposit and extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws that are proven to reduce plastic pollution and increase recycling rates.\\nWaste Management (WM) reportedly lobbied against EPR legislation in California in 2019, in contrast to peers like Republic Services that supported the legislation. This was despite Waste Management’s CEO saying: “we are supporting the development of domestic recycling markets.” WM actually has a public stance against EPR programs for materials such as paper, packaging, and bottles, claiming these materials are already handled under curbside recycling programs. Yet, EPA data shows only nine percent of the 34.5 million tons of plastic waste generated in the U.S. was recycled in 2015; seventy five percent was sent to landfill.\\nProponents believe more can be done to divert plastic waste from landfill and boost recycling rates above nine percent. Because Waste Management brands itself as “North America’s leading post-consumer recycler,” proponents believe Waste Management is uniquely suited and has a responsibility to further provide constructive solutions to reduce plastic waste and strengthen plastic recycling in the United States.\\n\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request the Board of Directors of Waste Management issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, discussing if, and how, the Company can increase the scale and pace of its efforts to constructively support industry and public policy solutions to address the environmental problems caused by plastic pollution.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nIn the report, shareholders suggest Waste Management discuss the following strategies, among others, at board and management discretion:\\nAn assessment by region or state comparing collected plastic waste materials with local market demand and providing recommendations for establishing new plastic processing facilities in local markets to address any gaps;\\nThe current technical efficiency of its material recovery facilities (MRFs) and availability of cost-effective upgrades that would boost recycling yields;\\nA root cause assessment of economic and technical challenges at MRFs, including identifying lost-time impacts of top contaminants (e.g. plastic bags);\\nEfforts to facilitate public policy initiatives that would reduce the environmental impacts of plastic waste without harming the Company, including various container deposit and EPR type legislation.\\n',\n",

       " 'Banks play a critical role in meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The Bank of England notes that the global financial system is currently supporting carbon-producing projects that will cause global temperature rise over 4 degrees Celsius – more than double the limit necessary to avoid catastrophic warming.[1]\\nThe 2018 Intergovernmental Panel report on climate warns that global warming above 1.5 degrees will create devastating impacts, including loss of life, ecosystem destruction, infrastructure damage, and supply chain disruptions. If warming is kept to 1.5 versus 2 degrees, studies report savings of $20 trillion to the global economy by 2100.[2] Recently, 215 global companies reported almost $1 trillion at risk from climate impacts, some within five years.[3]\\nWells Fargo’s funding contributes to global climate risk. It is the second largest source of financing to fossil fuel companies globally, averaging $50 billion annually since the Paris Agreement was signed.[4]Significantly, its fossil fuel lending has increased over each of the last three years, creating systemic portfolio risks to investors and the company’s own enterprise.\\xa0\\nPeer banks are beginning to responsibly manage climate risk by developing carbon measurement tools including the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials.[5] HSBC has committed to set a Science-Based Target.[6] ING, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and other banks have committed to measure the climate alignment of their lending portfolios against Paris goals.[7] Some have abandoned high risk sectors including Arctic drilling and tar sands.[8]Citibank joined the Principles for Responsible Banking, committing to align its business strategy with the Paris Agreement’s global climate goals.\\nWhile Wells recognizes climate change, has increased its ‘sustainable’ financing,[9] and is sourcing renewable energy for its operations, its annual $15 billion in sustainable financing over 13 years is substantially outweighed by its fossil fuel funding activities.[10] Wells does not yet measure or disclose its full carbon emissions, nor has it adopted targets to reduce its lending related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Banks that finance carbon intensive fossil fuel activities through their lending are putting themselves and society at risk of catastrophic climate impacts.\\xa0\\nResolved:\\nShareholders request that Wells Fargo issue a report at reasonable cost outlining if and how it intends to reduce the GHG emissions associated with its lending activities in alignment with the Paris Agreements goal of maintaining global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nSupporting Statement:\\nShareholders recommend the report disclose, among other issues, at board and management discretion:\\nAny actions Wells is taking to measure and disclose its full carbon footprint (Scope 1-3 emissions, including GHG emissions associated with its lending activities);\\nWhether the bank is considering setting targets, and on what timeline, to reduce the carbon footprint of its lending activities.\\nAny planned reductions in financing of high risk fossil fuels such as tar sands, Arctic drilling.\\n']"
